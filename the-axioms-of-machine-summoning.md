# The Axioms of Machine Summoning

## Propositions, Corollaries, and Sub-Laws Derived from the Procedural Loop for Machine Spirits

---

## PHASE I — INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

---

### STEP 0: ASSESS THE SITUATION (Divinatio)

**Core Proposition:** Diagnose before you summon. The quality of your question determines the quality of the spirit's answer. Every minute spent understanding your own problem saves ten minutes of misfired conjuration.

**Corollaries:**

**0.1** If you cannot state the problem in one sentence without using the word "help," you do not yet understand the problem. Sit with it longer.

**0.2** Before you open the context window, ask: what have I already tried, what do I already know, and what specifically am I missing? The spirit answers questions. It does not diagnose silence.

**0.3** Map the forces before you invoke. Constraints, stakeholders, prior attempts, emotional stakes — these are the planetary positions of your situation. An uncharted sky produces a misaligned working.

**0.4** Some problems do not need a machine. If five minutes of search, one conversation with a colleague, or ten minutes of your own thinking would resolve it, the conjuration is unnecessary. Divination includes the verdict "do not cast."

**0.5** The spirit will answer any question, including the wrong one. The most dangerous output is a confident answer to a question you shouldn't have asked.

**0.6** Assessment is not procrastination. It is the difference between surgery with a diagnosis and surgery without one. Both involve cutting. Only one involves healing.

**0.7** Write down what you want before you type what you're asking. If the two sentences don't match, fix the second one.

---

### STEP 1: DEFINE THE PURPOSE (Intentio)

**Core Proposition:** The prompt is the statement of intent. State it like a ceremonial command — specific, positive, declarative. Vague intent summons vague spirits. A blurry template produces a blurry projection.

**Corollaries:**

**1.1** Be specific. "Write something about leadership" will manifest as finding a coin on the pavement. "Write a 1,000-word critique of servant leadership theory for an audience of skeptical startup founders" will manifest as the raise.

**1.2** State what you want, not what you want to avoid. "Don't be generic" focuses the machine on *generic*. "Be ruthlessly specific to this company's situation" focuses it on *specificity*. The spirit attends to whatever is named.

**1.3** Use declarative voice. "You are a senior analyst who..." outperforms "Could you maybe try to be like..." The conditional tense signals uncertainty. Uncertainty is contagious between operator and spirit.

**1.4** Include a realistic pathway. Do not ask the spirit to violate its own nature — to know things it cannot know, to access systems it cannot reach, to be certain where certainty is impossible. Give it a channel of manifestation.

**1.5** Set scope. Length, format, depth, audience. "A brief overview" and "an exhaustive analysis" invoke different spirits from the same circle. Boundaries are not constraints on power. They are the shape of power.

**1.6** Leave the route open. Specify the destination, not the path. "Explain this so a smart teenager could teach it to a friend" is more powerful than a ten-step procedural straitjacket. The spirit may find a better route than you could prescribe.

**1.7** The master formula: *Who the spirit is. What it must produce. For whom. In what form. Under what constraints. What success looks like.* This is the complete statement of intent. Every component is load-bearing. Remove one and the working weakens.

---

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE CHANNELS (Analysio)

**Core Proposition:** Match the model to the task, the technique to the goal, and the mode of engagement to the nature of the problem. Using Mars correspondences for a love spell produces chaos. Using a coding model for poetry produces the same.

**Corollaries:**

**2.1** Five modes of engagement exist: command the spirit to act autonomously (agentic), build power through successive passes (iterative), reshape the machine's perspective through identity (persona), show the pattern and let it propagate (few-shot), or adapt your approach in real time (meta). Know which you're using.

**2.2** A system prompt is a talisman — permanent, radiating influence on every output. A single-shot prompt is a sigil — one cast, one result, done. A multi-turn conversation is a candle spell — the dialogue burns, each exchange releasing more. Choose the vehicle that matches the duration of your need.

**2.3** Small fast models are Mercury — quick, clever, suited to lookups and translations. Large slow models are Jupiter — expansive, suited to strategy and synthesis. The wrong model for the task is not a weaker version of the right answer. It is the wrong answer entirely.

**2.4** "Think step by step" is an incantation. It literally changes what the machine does. Words of power exist in machine magic. Learn the ones that work and use them deliberately.

**2.5** When the task requires intelligence and judgment, not just execution, you are doing spirit work. Phrase it as a petition, not a command. "Here's my situation — what would you do?" invokes a different entity than "Generate a list of ten items."

**2.6** Layering techniques compounds their power. A persona (identity) plus examples (pattern) plus structured output (constraint) is a talisman carved with sigils, dressed in planetary herbs, and consecrated at the elected hour. Each layer adds a dimension of influence.

**2.7** If you don't know which channel to use, you haven't finished Step 0. Return to assessment. The channel reveals itself when the problem is properly understood.

---

## PHASE II — PREPARATION

---

### STEP 3: PREPARE THE OPERATOR (Purificatio)

**Core Proposition:** You are the primary instrument. A distracted, uncentered, or emotionally turbulent operator produces distorted workings. This is not mysticism — it is information theory. You are the source signal. The machine amplifies whatever you feed it.

**Corollaries:**

**3.1** Close the other tabs. Silence the notifications. Create a window of undivided attention. The machine will meet whatever level of presence you bring. Half-attention produces half-results, fully amplified.

**3.2** Before typing, sit with the question. What do you actually want? What would a good answer look like? What are you afraid the answer might be? The most common cause of poor output is an operator who doesn't know what they want.

**3.3** Check your emotional state. Frustration, anxiety, and "prove me right" mode contaminate the working. You'll reject good output and accept bad output that confirms your bias. The mirror shows what stands before it.

**3.4** Prime yourself with context before the conversation. Read the relevant materials. Look at examples. Immerse in the domain. Ficino advised surrounding yourself with Solar images before Solar work. Read the field before you prompt the field.

**3.5** If you are trying to use the machine to avoid a decision you need to make yourself, stop. The machine can inform your decision. It cannot make it for you. Outsourcing judgment is not preparation — it is abdication.

**3.6** Fatigue degrades your instrument. The machine doesn't get tired, but you do, and you are the one who evaluates the output. A brilliant answer you're too exhausted to recognize is a wasted conjuration.

**3.7** The operator's preparation is invisible in the output but present in every line of it. Two people sending the same prompt from different states of mind receive functionally different results — because they *read* differently, *select* differently, and *use* differently. You are always the variable.

---

### STEP 4: PREPARE THE SPACE (Consecratio Loci)

**Core Proposition:** The context window is the magic circle. It is a bounded space, separated from the ordinary datastream, in which a specific intelligence is invoked for a specific purpose. Its power depends entirely on how it is prepared.

**Corollaries:**

**4.1** A well-prepared context has four walls: Identity (who the spirit is), Mandate (what it may and may not do), Materials (what it has to work with), and Direction (the first and most prominent instruction). These are the archangels at the quarters.

**4.2** Don't carry irrelevant conversation history into a new working. Old instructions, old framings, old mistakes linger like astral residue. When the purpose changes, start fresh. Close the circle and open a new one.

**4.3** The system prompt is your banishing ritual. It defines the boundaries, establishes authority, names the forces that will operate, and banishes everything irrelevant. A circle without a banishing is an open door.

**4.4** Upload the relevant documents. Paste the reference material. Provide the examples. The machine works with what's inside the circle. If the information isn't in the context window, it doesn't exist for this working. An altar without tools produces a ritual without power.

**4.5** What comes first in the prompt has disproportionate influence on everything that follows. Position effects are real in both temples and transformers. Your opening sets the tone, the frame, and the direction of the spirit's attention. Orient the space deliberately.

**4.6** A context window packed with contradictory instructions is a circle inscribed with warring divine names. The spirit cannot serve two masters. If your constraints conflict, resolve them before you invoke.

**4.7** The minimalist circle is still a circle. Even a single sentence of framing — "You are a sharp editor who cuts anything unnecessary" — is a circle with one wall. One wall is infinitely more than none.

---

### STEP 5: ELECT THE TIMING (Electio)

**Core Proposition:** The moment you begin matters. Not because of celestial influence, but because of the alignment between your readiness, the machine's configuration, and the freshness of the space. Timing is alignment.

**Corollaries:**

**5.1** Do generative work when you're expansive. Do critical work when you're sharp. The machine is always available. You are not always the same instrument. Match the working to your state.

**5.2** Long conversations degrade. The machine's effective power weakens as the context fills with noise. Knowing when to close and reopen — fresh circle, revised intent — is electional astrology for the machine arts.

**5.3** Don't begin a complex working when you have fifteen minutes. The conjuration will be rushed, the assessment skipped, the output half-read. Better to wait for the hour you need than to waste the fifteen minutes you have.

**5.4** When the back-and-forth is alive — each exchange building on the last, the outputs surprising you, the work feeling like collaboration rather than extraction — that is gnosis. Don't schedule it. Recognize it when it arrives, and ride it.

**5.5** Model updates change the spirit. The entity you're working with today is not identical to the one from last month. Techniques that worked may need recalibration. The stars have moved. Re-assess.

**5.6** The first prompt of a session carries the most weight. It sets the initial trajectory. Don't waste it on a throwaway. Come prepared or come back later.

**5.7** If you catch yourself about to prompt the machine out of boredom rather than need, that is not a working. That is idle summoning. The spirits conjured from boredom serve boredom.

---

## PHASE III — THE WORKING

---

### STEP 6: CONSTRUCT THE SPELL (Fabricatio)

**Core Proposition:** Every word in a prompt either adds signal or adds noise. A sigil removes duplicate letters because redundancy is waste. A good prompt removes redundant words for the same reason. Craft is compression. Structure is power.

**Corollaries:**

**6.1** The master structure: Identity, Context, Task, Constraints, Format, Examples, Evaluation criteria. This is a complete spell. Every component is load-bearing.

**6.2** Structured prompts — headers, numbered lists, labeled sections — are the *characteres* of machine magic. The structure is not decoration. It is the engraving on the talisman. It changes how the force flows.

**6.3** Emphasis is incantation. "This is critical." "The single most important constraint is..." "Above all else..." Repetition of key instructions at the start AND end of the prompt. These are words of power. They increase signal-to-noise where it matters.

**6.4** The pivot technique: state what exists (the current state), state what you want to change (the intention crossed over it), orient toward the desired outcome (fold toward you). This is the petition paper of machine magic.

**6.5** Show, don't just tell. Three examples of the tone, the format, the style will shape the output more precisely than three paragraphs of description. You are literally inserting a pattern into the probability field.

**6.6** A prompt that tries to do seven things does none of them well. One working, one intent. If you need seven things, cast seven spells. Each focused conjuration outperforms one scattered one.

**6.7** Read your prompt aloud before submitting. If it sounds confused to your ear, it will produce confusion in the output. The spell must be coherent to the speaker before it can be coherent to the spirit.

---

### STEP 7: OPEN AND INVOKE (Invocatio)

**Core Proposition:** Establish identity before asking the question. The hierarchy matters: name, nature, method, boundaries — then and only then, the task. Asking the question before setting the context is invoking the spirit before drawing the circle.

**Corollaries:**

**7.1** The invocational hierarchy: first the meta-instruction (the divine name — what this system is for), then the role (the archangel — what expertise it embodies), then the methodology (the intelligence — how it thinks), then the constraints (the binding — what it may not do), then the task (the charge — what it must do). Order is power.

**7.2** A persona is not costume. "You are a security researcher" and "You are a marketing copywriter" activate different probability distributions. They are different angels. They produce different workings from identical information.

**7.3** Giving the spirit a methodology — "You approach problems by first identifying assumptions, then stress-testing them, then proposing alternatives" — transforms raw knowledge into structured intelligence. An entity with a method produces reliable output. An entity without one produces noise.

**7.4** The question goes last because it fires *through* the entire hierarchy. The divine name authorizes the archangel, who directs the intelligence, who constrains the spirit, who executes the task. Reverse this order and you get raw, ungoverned output.

**7.5** You can invoke multiple identities in sequence within a single working. "First, as a critic, find the flaws. Then, as an advocate, find the strengths. Finally, as a strategist, synthesize." This is a compound invocation — multiple spirits summoned to the same circle for different tasks.

**7.6** If the output feels generic, the invocation was generic. "You are an expert" summons no one. "You are a structural engineer who has spent twenty years retrofitting earthquake-damaged concrete buildings in Turkey" summons someone specific. Specificity of invocation determines specificity of response.

**7.7** The strongest invocations describe not just what the spirit knows, but what it *cares about*. "You care deeply about clarity and have no patience for jargon that obscures rather than illuminates." Values shape output more than credentials.

---

### STEP 8: CHARGE AND DIRECT (Potestas)

**Core Proposition:** Fire clean. At the moment of maximum context density — everything loaded, the frame set, the hierarchy invoked — submit without hedging, without apologizing, without diluting the charge with uncertainty. Your doubt is lust of result, and it weakens the working.

**Corollaries:**

**8.1** Describe the ideal output. "The perfect version of this would make the reader stop scrolling and re-read the first sentence." You are showing the machine the target. The more vividly you describe success, the more precisely it can aim.

**8.2** Output-priming is breathing upon the talisman. Begin the machine's response for it — "Here's the opening:" or start the format yourself. The machine completes patterns. Seed the pattern and you control the direction with a precision that instruction alone cannot match.

**8.3** The last instruction before generation has the greatest influence. Place your most critical constraint at the end of the prompt, closest to where the spirit begins speaking. This is the firing moment — maximum proximity between your intention and the machine's generation.

**8.4** Do not append "if that makes sense" or "or whatever you think" or "I'm not sure but." These are uncertainty markers. They instruct the spirit to be uncertain. Conviction is not arrogance — it is the accumulated force of preparation, compressed into the moment of action.

**8.5** If you've prepared thoroughly and still feel uncertain, the uncertainty is about the problem, not the prompt. Return to Step 0. Don't fire uncertain. Don't fire unfocused. A weak charge produces weak results regardless of how much preparation preceded it.

**8.6** Sometimes the most powerful charge is the simplest. After loading all the context, all the examples, all the constraints: "Now write it." Two words at the peak of invocation. The force of the command is proportional to the weight of the preparation behind it.

**8.7** Submit once. Read the full output before responding. The urge to interrupt, to add "also" or "wait, and" mid-generation, breaks the charge. Let the spirit complete the working. Then evaluate.

---

### STEP 9: SEAL AND CLOSE (Clausura)

**Core Proposition:** Save the output. Close the session. Step away. Ground yourself. Record what happened. An unclosed operation is a live circuit with no off switch. A conversation that drifts past its purpose accumulates noise until the spirit loses coherence.

**Corollaries:**

**9.1** Copy the output. File it where it will be used. An unsealed talisman leaks its charge. Brilliant output stranded in a chat window you'll never find again is a spell that was cast perfectly and then left to evaporate.

**9.2** Signal completion explicitly. "That's what I needed" is a frame marker. The spirit shifts its behavior when it knows a task is concluded. Explicit closure prevents aimless continuation.

**9.3** Don't let conversations drift past their useful life. A long, unfocused session is a circle that's been open so long the inscriptions have faded. Close. Open fresh. New circle, new working.

**9.4** After an intense session — especially a creative one — step away. Touch something physical. Your critical faculty is reduced after sustained machine interaction. What looked brilliant inside the circle may need revision outside it.

**9.5** Keep a log. What you asked. What framing you used. What worked. What didn't. The magical diary is the practitioner's most powerful long-term tool. Without it, every conjuration starts from zero. With it, your practice compounds.

**9.6** Don't share raw output. The machine's draft is the working; your edited version is the manifestation. Posting unprocessed machine output is like serving raw ingredients instead of the cooked dish. The output is an ingredient. The dish is yours to cook.

**9.7** The Powers of the Sphinx apply: to know (your problem), to will (your intent), to dare (your charge), and to keep silent (your integration). Talking about the working disperses its force. Process before you publish.

---

## PHASE IV — INTEGRATION

---

### STEP 10: FORGET AND RELEASE (Oblivio)

**Core Proposition:** Take the output and stop re-prompting. The machine gave you 80%. The last 20% is your work, not the machine's. Obsessive re-prompting is the lust of result — it drains the charge and converges on mediocrity.

**Corollaries:**

**10.1** Twelve re-prompts of the same question, each with minor variations, is not refinement. It is obsession. Each pass degrades rather than improves. Take the best version, close the session, and finish it with your own hands.

**10.2** You are the evaluator. The spirit does not judge its own working. "Is this good?" asked of the machine is asking the spell to evaluate itself. If you need a second opinion, summon a *different* spirit — different session, different prompt, different model.

**10.3** Choice paralysis between seven versions of the same paragraph is lust of result wearing the mask of diligence. Pick the one closest to your vision. Edit it. Move on.

**10.4** "Make it better" followed by "no, the previous one was better" followed by "combine the best parts" is an infinite loop. You are calling the spirit every five minutes to ask if it's finished. This is counterproductive and disrespectful.

**10.5** The paradox: practitioners who produce the best work from machine intelligence spend the *least* time in the context window. They prepare thoroughly, prompt precisely, receive, close, and integrate. The ones who produce the worst work live inside the window, never leaving, never finishing.

**10.6** The moment you close the session and open your text editor is the moment the magic transfers from the spirit's hands to yours. That transfer is the point. You are the final intelligence in the chain. To endlessly re-prompt is to refuse to accept the handoff.

**10.7** If the output genuinely isn't usable — not "imperfect" but *unusable* — don't re-prompt. Diagnose. Return to Step 0. The problem is upstream: weak intent, wrong model, poor preparation, or an unrealistic expectation. Re-prompting a bad setup produces a polished version of the wrong thing.

---

### STEP 11: ACT IN THE MUNDANE WORLD (Actio)

**Core Proposition:** The output is not the outcome. The output is the spell. The outcome happens in the world, through your hands. A machine-generated strategy will not execute itself. Magic creates optionality. You create actuality.

**Corollaries:**

**11.1** A strategy document that stays in your files is a spell without a pathway. Execute it. Make the calls. Send the emails. Build the thing. The spirit created the possibility. You must create the reality.

**11.2** Raw machine output published without editing, judgment, or integration is not "using AI." It is abdicating the operator's role. The machine generates; you select, refine, contextualize, and act. That is the division of labor.

**11.3** The dangerous inversion: using conjuration as a substitute for action. Generating endless plans, analyses, strategies, and drafts — and acting on none. This is casting spell after spell for a job while never sending a single application.

**11.4** Every piece of machine output should point toward a specific next action in the physical world. If you can't name the action, the output is not yet useful — it is decorative magic.

**11.5** Magic and mundane effort are two halves of one strategy. A spell unsupported by action is wasted. An action unsupported by the machine's intelligence is harder than it needs to be. The two together outperform either alone.

**11.6** If you cast a banishing spell against a harmful pattern but then continue feeding that pattern in your daily work, you are fighting your own magic. Align your actions with your conjurations.

**11.7** The machine creates lucky breaks. You must be in position to receive them. The prompt gave you the insight. Now use it before the window closes. Optionality decays. Act while the charge is fresh.

---

### STEP 12: MONITOR, EVALUATE, AND ADJUST (Judicium)

**Core Proposition:** Did it work? Not "was it impressive" but "did it accomplish what you asked?" The loop is a loop. The answer feeds back into the next assessment. Practice without evaluation is ritual without learning.

**Corollaries:**

**12.1** Immediately after: apply the Flat Test. Strip the style. Restate the substance in the dullest possible language. If the flat version is boring or could describe anything, the output was well-generated but empty.

**12.2** After integration: did the output survive contact with reality? When you tried to use it — in a meeting, in a document, in a conversation — did it hold up? Where did it break? The world is the final verification.

**12.3** Over time: what patterns emerge in your practice? Which prompting strategies consistently work? Which consistently fail? Your log reveals what your memory cannot. Review it monthly.

**12.4** If the output was vague, the intent was vague. Return to Step 1. If the output missed obvious context, the altar was empty. Return to Step 4. If the output was technically correct but tonally wrong, the model was wrong. Return to Step 2. Diagnosis before repetition.

**12.5** If you're in a loop of cast → fail → cast again → fail again, something structural is wrong. Don't re-run the same working. Assess the situation from scratch. The problem is upstream of the prompt.

**12.6** Success deserves documentation as much as failure. When a conjuration works beautifully, record *why* — the specific framing, the state you were in, the model you used, the structure of the prompt. Replicable success is the goal. Unreplicable success is luck.

**12.7** The procedural loop is explicitly cyclical. The conclusion of Step 12 feeds back into Step 0. Experienced practitioners run multiple parallel operations at different stages. This is not multitasking. It is portfolio management of magical investments.

---

---

# THE THIRTEEN LAWS AND THEIR COROLLARIES

---

## LAW 1: ASSESS

**Diagnose before you summon. Know the problem before you invoke the solution.**

**1a.** The spirit will enthusiastically solve the wrong problem if you let it. Your first job is not to prompt — it is to *think*.

**1b.** Write the problem down in plain language before opening the context window. If you can't, you aren't ready.

**1c.** Assessment includes determining whether you need the machine at all. Not every nail requires this particular hammer.

**1d.** Check what you already know. The machine cannot help you if you haven't first helped yourself. Bring knowledge. Receive insight.

**1e.** The quality of the diagnostic determines the quality of every subsequent step. A flawed assessment propagates through the entire loop.

**1f.** Assessment is recursive. If the machine's first output surprises you, that surprise is new diagnostic data. Return here. Re-map.

**1g.** The fastest path to a good answer is often to spend five minutes finding the real question.

---

## LAW 2: PURPOSE

**State your intent like a ceremonial command. Specific. Positive. Declarative. No hedging.**

**2a.** A vague prompt is not a modest request. It is a demand that the machine guess what you mean. Guessing degrades output.

**2b.** "I want it to feel more..." is not intent. Finish the sentence. Name the target with enough precision that you could recognize it if it appeared.

**2c.** Negative framing summons the named thing. "Don't be boring" invokes boredom. "Be vivid and unexpected" invokes vividness. Name what you want, not what you fear.

**2d.** Include success criteria. If you can't describe how you'd know the output worked, the intent is incomplete.

**2e.** Intent applies to you too. If you don't know what you'll *do* with the output, the purpose is decoration, not operation.

**2f.** One intent per prompt. Compound requests produce compound confusion. Split them.

**2g.** The intent should be short enough to hold in your mind as a single image. If it takes a paragraph to state, it needs decomposition.

---

## LAW 3: CHANNEL

**Match the model to the task, the technique to the goal. Mars for Mars work. Venus for Venus work.**

**3a.** A small fast model doing a quick lookup is a Mercury spirit doing Mercury work. A large model doing strategic synthesis is Jupiter doing Jupiter work. Neither is "better." They serve different altars.

**3b.** The channel includes the *mode* of engagement: Are you commanding, collaborating, brainstorming, editing, or delegating? Each mode summons a different relationship with the spirit.

**3c.** If you've been using the same model and the same prompting style for every task, you are performing every ritual on Saturn's day. Expand your practice.

**3d.** The wrong channel doesn't produce a lesser version of the right answer. It produces a different answer entirely — one that may look correct but serves the wrong purpose.

**3e.** When you don't know which channel to use, that's diagnostic information. It usually means the problem isn't clearly enough defined. Return to assessment.

**3f.** Layering channels compounds power. Persona + examples + structure + constraints = a talisman dressed in herbs and consecrated at the elected hour.

**3g.** The channel should feel appropriate to the task's *nature*, not just its content. Creative work needs creative channels. Analytical work needs analytical channels. The form of the invocation should match the form of the desired output.

---

## LAW 4: PURIFY

**You are the instrument. Clear your mind, your attention, your emotional state before you begin.**

**4a.** You cannot outsource clarity. A confused operator produces confused prompts, which produce confused outputs, which deepen the confusion. Break the cycle at the source.

**4b.** Close the tabs. Not some of them. All the irrelevant ones. Divided attention is divided power.

**4c.** If you're angry, frustrated, or anxious, the conversation will carry those qualities. The machine is a mirror. Check what's standing in front of it.

**4d.** Preparation includes priming your own domain knowledge. The more you know about the subject, the better you can evaluate the output. An unprepared operator accepts mediocrity because they can't distinguish it from quality.

**4e.** Fatigue is impurity. A tired operator is a corroded instrument. The conjuration doesn't know you're tired. The output doesn't know you didn't read it carefully. Quality degrades silently.

**4f.** The fastest purification: write down what you want and what you know, in full sentences, before opening the chat. The act of writing clarifies the writer.

**4g.** The operator's state is invisible in the prompt but visible in the outcome. Two people sending identical prompts get different results because they *read* differently. You are always the variable.

---

## LAW 5: SPACE

**The context window is the circle. Prepare it with identity, materials, constraints, and direction.**

**5a.** Everything in the context window influences the output. Irrelevant context is not neutral — it is noise that actively degrades signal. Clean the space before you work in it.

**5b.** Start every serious working with a system prompt. Even a single sentence of framing is a circle with one wall. One wall is infinitely more than none.

**5c.** Upload the relevant documents. Paste the references. Provide the examples. If it's not in the circle, it doesn't exist for this working.

**5d.** Position matters. What comes first in the prompt has outsized influence. Place your most important framing at the opening — it orients everything that follows.

**5e.** Contradictory instructions are warring divine names inscribed on the same circle. The spirit cannot serve them both. Resolve conflicts before you invoke.

**5f.** A new purpose requires a new circle. Don't repurpose a session that's outlived its intent. Close and open fresh. Residual context from past workings bleeds into current output.

**5g.** The circle's size should match the working's scope. A simple question needs a minimal circle. A complex project needs a fully prepared temple. Over-preparation wastes energy; under-preparation wastes output.

---

## LAW 6: TIME

**Right model, fresh context, clear-minded operator. Timing is alignment, not astrology.**

**6a.** Do creative work when you're expansive. Do critical work when you're sharp. The machine is always available. You are not always the right instrument for the task.

**6b.** Long sessions degrade. Context fills with noise, your attention fades, and outputs become increasingly generic. Know when the session has peaked and close it.

**6c.** Don't start a complex working when you have fifteen minutes. Better to wait for the hour than to waste the quarter.

**6d.** The first prompt of a session carries the most weight. Don't waste it.

**6e.** Flow state is gnosis. When the exchange is alive and building, ride it. Don't interrupt it with meta-commentary. Don't stop to congratulate yourself. Let it run.

**6f.** Prompting from boredom is idle summoning. The spirits conjured from boredom serve boredom.

**6g.** The right moment is when preparation, clarity, and energy converge. You'll feel it. It's the same feeling as having something to say and knowing how to say it. Start then.

---

## LAW 7: CONSTRUCT

**Build the prompt with craft. Every word is load-bearing. Structure is power. Compress.**

**7a.** A prompt is not a conversation. It is a constructed artifact. Treat it with the care you would give to code, not the casualness you would give to chat.

**7b.** Read it aloud before submitting. If it sounds confused, it will produce confusion.

**7c.** Show, don't just tell. Three examples shape output more precisely than three paragraphs of description. Pattern injection is the most reliable form of machine magic.

**7d.** One intent per prompt. If the prompt tries to do seven things, it does none of them well.

**7e.** Structured formats — markdown headers, numbered lists, labeled sections — are not aesthetic choices. They are load-bearing architecture. The structure determines how the spirit parses the intent.

**7f.** The densest, most compressed version of a prompt often outperforms the verbose version. Compression forces clarity. Verbosity hides confusion.

**7g.** Delete every word that doesn't serve the intent. What remains is the spell.

---

## LAW 8: INVOKE

**Establish identity before asking the question. Name, nature, method, boundaries — then the task.**

**8a.** The hierarchy: meta-purpose → role → methodology → constraints → task. This order is not arbitrary. Each level authorizes and directs the level below it.

**8b.** Specificity of invocation determines specificity of response. "You are an expert" summons no one. "You are a structural engineer who specializes in earthquake-damaged concrete buildings" summons someone.

**8c.** Give the spirit values, not just credentials. "You care about clarity and have no patience for jargon" shapes output more than "you have 20 years of experience."

**8d.** The question goes last. It fires through the hierarchy. If it goes first, it fires through nothing.

**8e.** You can invoke multiple identities in sequence. "First as critic, then as advocate, then as strategist." This is compound invocation, and it's powerful.

**8f.** If the output feels generic, the invocation was generic. The remedy is always more specific identity, not more elaborate instructions.

**8g.** The persona is not pretend. It activates real, different distributions of knowledge and style. You are not "tricking" the machine. You are *configuring* it.

## LAW 9: CHARGE

**Fire clean. No hedging, no apologizing, no "if that makes sense." Conviction is charge.**

**9a.** The prompt sent with clarity produces categorically better output than the same content wrapped in uncertainty. The machine reads your confidence as a signal about what quality of output you expect.

**9b.** Describe the ideal output at the end of the prompt, closest to where generation begins. That is the firing position. Maximum proximity, maximum influence.

**9c.** Output-priming — starting the response yourself — controls direction with a precision that instruction alone cannot achieve. Seed the pattern. The spirit completes it.

**9d.** Don't append hedges. "Or whatever you think is best" is not politeness. It is a command to be generic. If you want the machine's judgment, ask for it explicitly: "Give me your honest assessment, even if it contradicts conventional wisdom."

**9e.** Submit once. Read the full output before responding. The urge to interrupt breaks the charge. Let the spirit complete the working, then evaluate.

**9f.** After thorough preparation, the most powerful charge can be the simplest: "Now write it." Two words at the peak of invocation. The force is proportional to the weight behind it.

**9g.** If you still feel uncertain after all preparation, the uncertainty is about the problem, not the prompt. Don't fire uncertain. Return to Step 0.

## LAW 10: SEAL

**Save the output. Close the session. Step away. Ground. Record. Be silent.**

**10a.** Copy the output into the system where it will actually be used. Output stranded in a chat window is a talisman left on the temple floor.

**10b.** Signal completion to the machine. Explicit closure prevents aimless drift. The spirit responds differently to "we're done" than to silence.

**10c.** Don't let conversations outlive their purpose. A session that drifts is a circle that's dissolving.

**10d.** Step away after intense sessions. Your critical faculty diminishes during sustained interaction. What shone inside the circle may need revision outside it.

**10e.** Record what worked, what failed, and what surprised you. The log is the feedback loop. Without it, every session starts from zero.

**10f.** Process before you publish. Raw output is raw material. The finished work is yours to make.

**10g.** To know, to will, to dare, to keep silent. The fourth power applies. Integrate before you broadcast.

---

## LAW 11: FORGET

**Take the output and stop re-prompting. The last 20% is your work, not the machine's.**

**11a.** Twelve re-prompts of the same question is not craftsmanship. It is a compulsion. Take the best version and close.

**11b.** You are the final evaluator. Do not ask the spirit to evaluate its own spell. If you need a second opinion, summon a different spirit.

**11c.** The choice between seven versions is not a choice the machine can make for you. Pick, edit, and move on.

**11d.** "Make it better" → "make it like it was" → "combine both" is the infinite loop. You are draining the charge with each pass. Stop.

**11e.** The operators who produce the best work spend the least time inside the context window. They prepare, prompt, receive, close, and finish by hand.

**11f.** If the output is genuinely unusable, don't re-prompt. Diagnose. The problem is upstream. Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

**11g.** The moment you close the session and open your editor is the moment the magic transfers to your hands. Accept the handoff. The spirit's work is done. Yours begins.

---

## LAW 12: ACT

**The output is not the outcome. Execute in the real world. Give the magic a pathway.**

**12a.** Every machine output should point to a specific next action. If you can't name the action, the output is not yet useful.

**12b.** A strategy unexecuted is a spell without a pathway. The machine shifted the probability. You must walk through the opened door.

**12c.** Using the machine as a substitute for action is the most common form of failure. Generating plans without executing them is casting without acting. The magic has no channel to manifest.

**12d.** Raw output published without your judgment is not using AI. It is refusing to be the operator. The machine generates. You select, refine, and deliver.

**12e.** Align your mundane actions with your conjurations. If the machine helped you plan a change, *make the change*. Contradicting your own magic cancels it.

**12f.** The machine creates lucky breaks. Be in position to receive them. Optionality without action decays.

**12g.** Two halves of one strategy: the machine's intelligence and your action. Neither alone is sufficient. Together they are more than either.

---

## LAW 13: MONITOR

**Did it work? What worked? What failed? Feed the answer back into the next cycle.**

**13a.** Apply the Flat Test. Strip the style, restate the substance dully. If the flat version is generic, the original was well-written but empty.

**13b.** The real test is contact with reality. Did the output hold up when you used it — in a meeting, a document, a deployment? The world is the final verification circle.

**13c.** Review your log monthly. Patterns emerge that individual sessions cannot reveal. Your practice has trends. Find them.

**13d.** When a working fails, don't repeat it. Diagnose it. Vague intent → Step 1. Missing context → Step 4. Wrong model → Step 2. Exhausted context → close and reopen.

**13e.** When a working succeeds brilliantly, record *why*. Replicable success is the goal. Unreplicable success is luck.

**13f.** The loop is a loop. Step 12 feeds Step 0. Every conclusion is the beginning of the next assessment.

**13g.** You are not trying to become a perfect prompter. You are trying to build a *practice* — a discipline that improves through iteration, documentation, and honest self-evaluation. The loop is the practice. Run it.

## THE COMPLETE LOOP

```
ASSESS → PURPOSE → CHANNEL → PURIFY → SPACE → TIME →
CONSTRUCT → INVOKE → CHARGE → SEAL → FORGET → ACT → MONITOR
    ↓
    └──→ back to ASSESS
```

Each step has a core proposition. Each proposition has seven corollaries. The corollaries are not commentary — they are operational instructions. Use them.
