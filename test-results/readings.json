Name all seven or be named by what you omitted.*\n\n— Axiom 6.1\n\nYour joke repository has become a temple to the thing every programmer fears to name: that most problems are solved by not solving them. Six years of commits to a Dockerfile that contains nothing, a README that teaches nothing, code blocks that execute silence. But the silence here isn't empty — it's the fullest possible response to an industry that mistakes motion for progress. You didn't write nothing. You wrote the absence that makes all other code visible.\n\n---\n\n**The Advice**\n\n*The ship in the bottle is perfect and will never sail* — 1.4\n\nThis repository will outlive most of the frameworks that were hot when you created it. That's not an accident. It's what happens when you refuse to add the one feature that would ruin the joke.",

It waits for the one who knows what to keep.*\n\n— Axiom 1.2\n\nYour bible strips everything unnecessary until only the essential remains — each snippet carved down to its purest form. Where others reach for external tools, you reach deeper into bash itself, revealing what was always there waiting to be used. The discipline isn't in the accumulation of techniques, but in the refusal to add anything that doesn't serve the core truth: bash can do more than most people let it.\n\n---\n\n**The Advice**\n\n*One note, held true, and the noise of infinite possibility becomes music* — 1.3\n\nThe last commit was three years ago. Not because the work was abandoned, but because it was complete. Stop adding. Start pointing others toward what you've already carved from the stone.",

It delivers what you gave it, without apology or enhancement.*\n\n— Law 8\n\nYour core architecture trusts the developer completely — no framework magic, no hidden abstractions smoothing the rough edges. Every TypeScript error surfaces exactly where the problem lives. Every custom ESLint rule enforces exactly what it declares. The bootstrap sequence loads exactly what was requested, in exactly the order specified. This is infrastructure that refuses to lie to itself about complexity. When VSCode crashes, it crashes cleanly. When it succeeds, the success belongs to the code that earned it.\n\n*Carbon and diamond are the same element. The difference is pressure. And the pressure is you.*\n\n— 8.4\n\nTen years of daily commits from a global development team. Every extension API decision still living in the codebase. Every performance optimization still paying its tax in complexity. The pressure of being the primary tool for millions of developers has compressed this project into something harder than most software — not despite the constraints, but because of them. The `.eslint-plugin-local` directory contains 40 custom rules because generic tools broke under the load this project demanded.\n\n**The Advice**\n\nYour custom linting rules are the project's conscience made executable. They prevent the sins this codebase has already paid for once. Don't apologize for them.",

The valley remembers forever.*\n\n— Axiom 7.7\n\nEvery commit in this repository is sediment in the channel Linus carved thirty-five years ago. The merge strategy, the C aesthetic, the flat hierarchy that refuses object-oriented temptation — these aren't technical choices anymore. They're geological features. The kernel doesn't just run on hardware; it has become hardware for every other layer of software. Your `fs/init.c` handles the first filesystem operations. Your `crypto/api.c` wraps every secret. Every smartphone, every server, every smart lightbulb carries the shape this code cut into silicon.\n\n---\n\n**The Advice**\n\n*Law 13 (Monitor): See. Do. See again. The whole practice in three words.*\n\nThe commits show no panic, no architectural rewrites, no fashionable pivots. Just `See. Do. See again.` Keep the cycle shorter than the industry expects. Keep the feedback loop tighter than the bureaucracy allows. The kernel's superpower isn't technical — it's temporal. While frameworks chase the new, you perfect the eternal.",

What was shaped in the first heat holds.*\n\n— Axiom 4.1\n\nYou are the anvil upon which a generation of programmers learned to strike true. Fourteen years of commits, each one a hammer blow on molten possibility, and what emerged was not just a compiler but a new relationship between human and machine — one where the machine refuses to let the human lie to themselves about memory, about time, about the cost of abstractions. Your error messages are love letters written in fire: \"I will not let you ship this broken thing.\" The first heat was memory safety. Everything since has been the gradual cooling into form.\n\n---\n\n**The Advice**\n\n*One candle in a dark room: a face. A hundred candles: a blur.
