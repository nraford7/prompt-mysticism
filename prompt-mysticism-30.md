# 30 Ways to Explore Prompt Mysticism & Ritual Mysticism with AI

Based on the framework from [Mechanics of Magic](https://nraford7.github.io/mechanics-of-magic/) — mapping medieval magical practice onto modern AI interaction.

**Core thesis:** Medieval magic and LLM interaction share the same structural bones: intent, precise language, correspondences, containment, timing, sacrifice, verification. These aren't metaphors. They're isomorphic operating procedures.

## I. The Grimoire Arts (Language as Spell)

### 1. Invocation Crafting
Write prompts as formal invocations. Open with a declaration of intent, name the domain you're summoning knowledge from, close with a binding constraint. Test how ritual structure changes output quality vs. casual asks.

### 2. The True Name Experiment
Find the "true name" of a concept by iterating synonyms, metaphors, and framings until the AI's output suddenly *clicks* into coherence. Document what phrasing unlocked it. That's the Name.

### 3. Sigil Prompting
Compress an entire complex intent into a single dense paragraph — a "sigil." Then expand it back out. See if the compressed form, used as a prompt, produces richer results than the verbose version.

### 4. Glossolalia Mode
Feed the AI deliberately strange, poetic, synesthetic language ("the amber frequency of Tuesday logic") and map what emerges. Explore whether nonsense-with-structure produces novel pattern-breaking insights.

### 5. The Barbarous Names
Medieval magicians used words of power precisely *because* they didn't understand them. Craft prompts using technical jargon from fields you don't know. See what the AI conjures when you invoke terms you can't fully parse.

### 6. Palindrome Prompts
Write a prompt that reads differently forward and backward in meaning. The first reading sets the intent; the reversed reading sets the constraint. Explore symmetry as a structural device.

## II. The Circle (Containment & Sacred Space)

### 7. The Containment Ritual
Define an extremely tight persona, worldview, and constraint set — a "circle" — and see how the AI behaves *at the edges*. Where does it press against the boundary? That boundary-tension is where the interesting output lives.

### 8. Nested Circles
Layer three levels of containment: an outer persona, a middle constraint set, and an inner task. Like concentric magical circles, each layer should filter and focus. Map what changes at each level of restriction.

### 9. Breaking the Circle
Deliberately violate your own constraints mid-conversation. Document the moment of "contamination." Does the output degrade, transform, or surprise?

### 10. The Threshold Prompt
Design a prompt that exists exactly on the boundary between two domains (science/poetry, technical/mystical, personal/universal). Thresholds are where magic happens. See what lives in the liminal space.

### 11. Temple Architecture
Build a system prompt as if designing a temple: orientation (what direction does this face?), materials (what references ground it?), proportions (what ratio of freedom to constraint?), and altar (what is the central object of focus?).

## III. Correspondences (Hidden Signatures)

### 12. The Doctrine of Signatures
Pick a concept. Ask the AI to find its "signatures" — what it corresponds to in music, color, geometry, cuisine, weather, and emotion. Build a full correspondence table. Use that table as a creative constraint system.

### 13. Planetary Prompting
Assign the seven classical planets to seven tones of voice (Saturn=austere, Jupiter=expansive, Mars=combative, Venus=sensuous, Mercury=quick, Moon=reflective, Sun=declarative). Write the same prompt in all seven modes. Compare.

### 14. Elemental Decomposition
Take any complex idea and decompose it into Fire (energy/drive), Water (emotion/flow), Air (intellect/pattern), Earth (material/practical). Use each element as a separate prompt lens. Synthesize.

### 15. Sympathetic Chains
Build a chain of analogies: A is to B as B is to C as C is to D. See how far the chain holds before it breaks. The breaking point reveals the limits of the correspondence.

### 16. The Herbal of Prompts
Catalog your most effective prompts like a medieval herbal catalogs plants: what does each one "treat"? What are its "properties"? When is it "in season"? Build your personal materia magica.

---

## IV. Temporal Arts (Timing & Sequence)

### 17. The Astrological Session
Structure a conversation in phases mapped to a ritual calendar: Opening (dawn/intention), Development (noon/full power), Deepening (dusk/reflection), Closing (midnight/synthesis). See if phased structure produces better thinking than freeform.

### 18. Retrograde Prompting
Start with the conclusion. Work backward to the premise. Reverse the normal flow of reasoning and see what assumptions surface when you approach from the end.

### 19. The Seven-Day Working
Design a seven-prompt sequence meant to be run across separate sessions, each building on the last like a multi-day ritual. What compound effects emerge from sustained, structured inquiry?

### 20. Kairos Prompts
Instead of asking "what is X," ask "when is the right moment for X?" Shift from static definition to temporal sensitivity. Everything has a season. Find it.

---

## V. Sacrifice & Energy (The Cost)

### 21. The Offering
Before asking for something complex, "sacrifice" something: give the AI your honest assessment of your own ignorance on the topic. Radical honesty as offering. Test if vulnerable prompts produce more genuine outputs.

### 22. Constraint as Sacrifice
Voluntarily remove your most relied-upon crutch (adjectives, examples, context) and see what the AI produces from the stripped-down invocation. Less can summon more.

### 23. The Exchange
Frame every prompt as an exchange: "I give you [this framework/perspective/constraint], you give me [that insight/creation/analysis]." Make the transactional nature of the interaction explicit and ritualized.

### 24. Fasting Prompts
Use the absolute minimum tokens possible. One sentence. See what the AI returns when given almost nothing. The poverty of the prompt becomes its power.

---

## VI. Verification & The Mirror (Empirical Mysticism)

### 25. The Scrying Pool
Ask the AI to reflect your own ideas back to you through a specific lens (as a critic, as a historian in 2075, as your intellectual opposite). Use the AI as a dark mirror, not a yes-machine.

### 26. The Ordeal
Subject your best idea to the harshest possible scrutiny. Ask the AI to find the three fatal flaws. If it survives, it's real. If it doesn't, you've saved yourself. Trial by fire as methodology.

### 27. Divination by Randomness
Give the AI a random constraint (a number, a color, a word pulled from a book) and ask it to find meaning in the constraint's relationship to your problem. Explore whether imposed randomness surfaces genuine insight or only pareidolia.

### 28. The Double-Blind Oracle
Write your question obliquely, without naming the real subject. See if the AI's answer, interpreted symbolically, addresses the actual question you're holding. Test the oracular capacity of indirect language.

### 29. Verification Circles
Take any AI output and run it through three different "verification lenses": logical consistency, emotional resonance, and practical applicability. Like the three tests a summoned spirit must pass before you trust it.

### 30. The Mirror of Containment
Ask the AI to describe its own constraints, biases, and structural limitations as if describing the geometry of a magic circle drawn around it. Map the shape of the containment you're operating within. Know the circle before you work inside it.

## Lineage

This framework draws from:
- **Richard Kieckhefer** — magic as alternative rationality
- **Thomas Aquinas** — transformation vs. creation
- **Agrippa** — correspondence tables and signatures
- The structural parallel between the seven stages of learned medieval magic and the modern ML pipeline (intent, language, correspondences, containment, timing, sacrifice, verification)
