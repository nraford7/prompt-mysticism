# The Revised Procedural Loop for Magical Operations

## A Complete Reference

**Synthesised from the Western Hermetic, Ceremonial, Chaos Magic, and Folk Magic Traditions**

---

## How to Read This Document

This reference presents the complete revised procedural loop for conducting a magical operation — whether that operation is the construction of an astrological talisman, the casting of a spoken spell, the firing of a chaos-magic sigil, or any other act of intentional magical practice. Each of the thirteen steps is presented with:

- **What it is** — a plain description of the step
- **Why it matters** — the theoretical rationale, i.e. what goes wrong if you skip it
- **How it is done** — the principal methods, ranging from elaborate ceremonial techniques to minimalist approaches
- **Where it comes from** — the historical and textual sources
- **Key context** — background information necessary to understand the step if approaching the subject for the first time

The thirteen steps are grouped into four phases: **Intelligence Gathering** (Steps 0–2), **Preparation** (Steps 3–5), **The Working** (Steps 6–9), and **Integration** (Steps 10–12). The Working phase is the ritual itself; everything before it is preparation and everything after it is follow-through. All four phases are considered essential to a complete operation.

---

## PHASE I — INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

*Before you act, understand what you're acting on, what you want, and what tools to use.*

---

### STEP 0: ASSESS THE SITUATION (Divinatio)

---

#### What It Is

Before beginning any magical operation, use divination or structured analysis to understand the current state of affairs — what forces are in play, what obstacles exist, what opportunities are available, what the likely outcome is if you do nothing, and whether a magical intervention is appropriate, advisable, or even necessary.

#### Why It Matters

A spell cast in ignorance of the actual situation is like surgery performed without a diagnosis. You may be aiming at the wrong target, working against forces you haven't identified, or trying to change something that is already moving in your favour without intervention. Divination provides the equivalent of a reconnaissance report before a military engagement. It also provides a *baseline* against which you can later measure whether the spell worked.

Without assessment, you risk:
- Wasting effort on a problem that would resolve itself naturally
- Directing force against the symptom rather than the cause
- Triggering unforeseen consequences because you didn't see the full picture
- Being unable to tell later whether the magic actually produced the observed change

#### How It Is Done

| Method | Description | Best For | Tradition |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Tarot reading** | A structured card spread (Celtic Cross, three-card past/present/future, or custom layout) used to map the forces surrounding the situation | Complex situations with multiple actors and influences; emotional/relational questions | Western occult tradition; Golden Dawn systematised tarot-Tree of Life correspondences |
| **Horary astrology** | Casting an astrological chart for the moment a question is asked; the chart's planetary positions answer the question | Specific factual questions ("Will I get the job?", "Where is the lost object?"); timing questions | Classical Hellenistic and Arabic astrology; William Lilly's *Christian Astrology* (1647) |
| **Geomancy** | Generating a series of binary figures (dots) by random process, then interpreting the resulting sixteen figures in a structured chart | Quick yes/no questions; practical matters; situations where tarot or astrology are unavailable | Arabic divination (*'ilm al-raml*, "science of the sand"); entered Europe via 12th-century translations; Agrippa covers it in *Three Books* IV |
| **Scrying** | Gazing into a reflective or translucent surface (crystal ball, black mirror, bowl of water, fire) in a light trance state to receive visual impressions | Intuitive/visionary information; contact with spirits or the unconscious; open-ended exploration | Ancient (Nostradamus, John Dee and Edward Kelley's Enochian scrying sessions); the Picatrix includes scrying techniques |
| **Pendulum/dowsing** | Using a suspended weight or rods to receive yes/no/directional answers via involuntary micro-muscle movements (ideomotor effect) | Simple binary questions; calibrating intuition | Folk tradition; widely used in practical magic and energy work |
| **Direct meditation/contemplation** | Sitting in silence, posing the question to the mind, and observing what arises — images, feelings, words, memories | When no formal divination tools are available; for practitioners with strong meditative training | Buddhist, Hermetic, and Quaker traditions of "waiting on the light" |
| **Bibliomancy / sortilege** | Opening a sacred or significant text at random and reading the passage as an answer; or casting lots (dice, bones, runes) | Quick guidance; confirming or challenging a decision already forming | Ancient (the Roman *sortes Virgilianae* — opening Virgil at random; I Ching; rune casting; African *Ifá* divination) |

#### Where It Comes From

Divination has been part of magical practice since the earliest recorded civilisations. Mesopotamian *bārû* priests interpreted omens, liver shapes (*hepatoscopy*), and celestial phenomena. Greek *manteis* at Delphi and Dodona channelled divine speech. The *Greek Magical Papyri* (PGM) contain numerous divination spells alongside their practical sorcery — demonstrating that in the ancient world, intelligence-gathering and spell-casting were always paired.

However, the explicit formalisation of divination as a *mandatory first step before every magical working* is largely a modern development. The classical Hermetic texts (Ficino, Agrippa, the Picatrix) assume the magus already knows what to do. The contemporary emphasis on "divine before you conjure" comes from:
- **Aleister Crowley**, who taught that divination should precede every significant magical operation (*Magick in Theory and Practice*, Chapter XVIII: "Of the Charge to the Spirit")
- **Jason Miller** (*Real Sorcery*; *The Elements of Spellcrafting*), who insists on divination as the first of his strategic steps and uses it for both pre-assessment and post-operation monitoring
- **Gordon White** (*The Chaos Protocols*), who combines tarot, astrological forecasting, and personal prediction into a comprehensive magical intelligence system

#### Key Context for Newcomers

*Divination* in this context does not mean predicting a fixed future. Most magical traditions understand the future as a field of probabilities, not a predetermined script. Divination reads the *current trajectory* — what will likely happen if present conditions continue — and allows the magician to decide whether and how to intervene. It is reconnaissance, not prophecy.

---

### STEP 1: DEFINE THE PURPOSE (Intentio)

---

#### What It Is

Formulate a clear, specific, positively-stated intention for the operation. Determine exactly what you want to accomplish, and express it in a form precise enough to guide every subsequent decision — choice of correspondences, timing, method, and evaluation criteria.

#### Why It Matters

The intention is the seed from which the entire operation grows. Every other choice flows from it. An ambiguous intention produces ambiguous results. A negatively-stated intention ("I don't want to be poor") focuses the mind on the very thing you wish to avoid, potentially reinforcing it. A vague intention ("I want things to be better") gives the magical force no specific target and no way to manifest concretely.

The intention also serves as the template that the imagination (Step 8) projects during the working. If the template is blurry, the projection will be blurry. If the template is sharp and specific, the projection will be sharp and specific.

Classical texts and modern practitioners alike consistently identify poorly-defined intent as the single most common cause of magical failure.

#### How It Is Done

**The Statement of Intent.** Most traditions advise writing down the intention as a single clear sentence. Chaos magic formalised this as the "Statement of Intent," typically beginning with "It is my will that..." or "My desire is..."

**Rules for formulating effective intentions:**

| Rule | Explanation | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Be specific** | "More money" could manifest as finding a coin on the pavement. Specify the amount, source, or outcome you actually want. | ❌ "I want more money" → ✅ "I will receive a raise of at least 10% at my current job within six months" |
| **State positively** | Describe what you want, not what you want to avoid. The mind and the magical force orient toward whatever is named. | ❌ "I don't want to be lonely" → ✅ "I will form a deep, fulfilling romantic relationship" |
| **Use present or future tense** | Past tense implies the event has already happened; conditional tense ("I would like...") implies uncertainty. Present tense ("I am...") or future declarative ("I will...") projects certainty. | ❌ "I would like to..." → ✅ "It is my will to..." or "I am now..." |
| **Include a realistic pathway** | Specify, or at least leave room for, a plausible mechanism of manifestation. Magic tends to work through coincidence, opportunity, and shifted probability, not through violation of physical law. | ❌ "Gold appears from thin air" → ✅ "Unexpected financial opportunities present themselves to me" |
| **Set a timeframe when possible** | Open-ended intentions can take indefinitely long. A timeframe creates urgency and provides a deadline for evaluation. | "...within the next three months" |
| **Leave the "how" open (usually)** | Over-specifying the mechanism can block easier paths of manifestation. You want the *outcome*, not a specific route to it. Some modern practitioners (Gordon White) disagree on this point and encode specific pathways into sigil shoals. | "I will receive £5,000" rather than "I will receive £5,000 from my aunt's inheritance" |

**Classifying the purpose by planetary governance.** If working within the Hermetic correspondence system, the intention must be classified under the domain of the appropriate planet, as this determines all subsequent material choices:

| Planet | Day | Domains | Examples of Intentions |
|--------|-----|---------|----------------------|
| **Saturn** ♄ | Saturday | Restriction, boundaries, endings, hidden knowledge, protection, agriculture, longevity, binding, cursing, dealings with the dead, patience, structure | "The harmful influence of [person/situation] is permanently removed from my life"; "I gain deep understanding of [occult subject]"; "My property is protected from all harm" |
| **Jupiter** ♃ | Thursday | Expansion, prosperity, abundance, honour, legal matters, academic success, generosity, favour from authority, religious/spiritual matters | "I am offered a well-paying position in my field"; "My legal case is resolved in my favour"; "I am recognised and honoured for my work" |
| **Mars** ♂ | Tuesday | Courage, victory, conflict, physical strength, surgery, competition, overcoming obstacles, lust, aggression, breaking through blockages | "I win the competition"; "I have the strength and courage to confront [situation]"; "All obstacles to [goal] are destroyed" |
| **Sun** ☉ | Sunday | Fame, visibility, health, vitality, leadership, success, confidence, illumination, creativity, gold, royal favour | "I radiate confidence and attract positive attention"; "My health is fully restored"; "I am recognised as a leader in my field" |
| **Venus** ♀ | Friday | Love, beauty, friendship, pleasure, fertility, art, harmony, reconciliation, luxury, social grace | "A loving and compatible romantic partner enters my life"; "The conflict between [parties] is harmoniously resolved"; "My artistic work reaches a wide and appreciative audience" |
| **Mercury** ☿ | Wednesday | Communication, eloquence, commerce, intelligence, skill, travel, contracts, writing, teaching, trickery, technology | "I communicate clearly and persuasively in [situation]"; "My business negotiations conclude successfully"; "I pass the examination with high marks" |
| **Moon** ☽ | Monday | Intuition, dreams, travel (especially by water), fertility, cycles, the unconscious, the public, emotions, psychic ability, messages | "My intuitive and psychic abilities are heightened and reliable"; "I conceive a healthy child"; "My public reputation improves" |

#### Where It Comes From

**The Picatrix** (Book II) provides extensive catalogues of talismanic purposes organised by planet, decan, and lunar mansion — effectively a medieval "menu" of intentions pre-classified by astrological governance. **Agrippa** (*Three Books of Occult Philosophy*, Book I, Chapters 22–31) assigns specific virtues, qualities, and effects to each planet, providing the theoretical basis for intention classification. **Crowley's** definition of magick as "causing Change to occur in conformity with Will" places the formulation of the Will (intention) as the definitional foundation of the entire art. **Jason Miller** (*The Elements of Spellcrafting*, Chapter 1) provides the most detailed modern treatment of intent formulation, including the distinction between "macro-enchantment" (broad life-direction magic) and "micro-enchantment" (specific situational spells).

#### Key Context for Newcomers

The *planetary classification of intentions* is not arbitrary. It derives from the ancient doctrine that each of the seven classical planets (visible to the naked eye) governs a specific domain of earthly experience. This doctrine was articulated by Ptolemy in the *Tetrabiblos* (2nd century CE), systematised in Arabic astrology by Abu Ma'shar (9th century), and adopted wholesale by medieval and Renaissance magicians. Even practitioners who do not literally believe in planetary influence often find the classification system useful as a *sorting mechanism* — a way of identifying which symbolic toolset (colours, metals, incense, divine names, spirits) to deploy for a given purpose.

---

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE CHANNELS (Analysio)

---

#### What It Is

Once the purpose is defined, determine *how* you will pursue it magically. This involves three decisions: (a) which operative model to use (spirit work, energy work, psychological/sigil work, or a combination); (b) which specific tradition, system, or set of correspondences to draw from; and (c) what specific materials, entities, symbols, and techniques the operation will require.

#### Why It Matters

A magical operation is an engineering problem: you must select the right tools and materials for the job. Using Mars correspondences for a love spell, or Venus correspondences for a conflict, will produce poor or chaotic results — you are sending the wrong signal on the wrong frequency. The classical tradition treated this step as largely deterministic: once you knew the planet, the correspondences were fixed by tradition. Contemporary practice offers more flexibility but still requires deliberate selection.

This step also forces the practitioner to think strategically. Should you make a talisman (persistent, slow-acting, radiates continuously)? Fire a sigil (fast, one-shot, works through probability)? Perform a candle spell (medium duration, visual focus, burns out)? Invoke a spirit and petition directly (potentially powerful, but requires relationship-building)? The choice of channel shapes everything that follows.

#### How It Is Done

**Decision 1: Select the operative model.** Peter Carroll's five-model framework provides the clearest decision tree:

| Model | When to Use It | What It Requires | Strengths | Limitations |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Spirit model** — Petition or command real entities (angels, demons, saints, ancestors, planetary intelligences, land spirits) to perform the work | When you have an established relationship with helpful spirits; when the task is complex and requires intelligence/agency; when you want ongoing support rather than a one-time push | Offerings, devotional practice, proper protocols for contact, knowledge of spirit hierarchies and names | Spirits can navigate complex situations, make judgement calls, and work continuously over time; some goals (like protection from other spirits) are best handled by spirits | Requires building and maintaining relationships; spirits have their own agendas; results can be unpredictable; some spirits demand ongoing reciprocity |
| **Energy model** — Accumulate and direct subtle energy (chi, prana, the Astral Light, the electromagnetic fluid) toward the target | When the goal is healing, personal empowerment, environmental cleansing, or direct energetic influence; when the practitioner has strong energy-work training | Developed subtle perception; ability to accumulate, move, and project energy; may use breathwork, visualisation, physical gestures | Immediate and tangible for the operator; good for healing and personal transformation; doesn't require external entities | Requires significant training in energy perception and control; less effective for complex multi-variable situations; risk of energetic depletion |
| **Psychological model** — Use symbols and rituals to reprogram the unconscious mind, which then restructures perception, behaviour, and the pattern of apparent coincidences in the operator's life | When the primary obstacle is internal (fear, self-sabotage, limiting beliefs, lack of confidence); for general probability-shifting; for goals where the operator's own behaviour is the main variable | Sigil creation and charging; visualisation; affirmation; ritual psychodrama; gnosis techniques | Minimal tools required; works within a materialist worldview; powerful for personal transformation and probability-shifting | Struggles with goals that have no plausible psychological pathway; some practitioners find it reductionist; doesn't account well for phenomena that appear genuinely anomalous |
| **Information model** — Magic operates by inserting information into the fabric of reality (or the "morphic field"), which then reorganises probability around the implanted pattern | When working at a distance; when the target is a situation or system rather than a person; for "butterfly effect" style interventions where a small nudge produces large downstream changes | Clear symbolic encoding of intent; precise firing at peak gnosis; divination to monitor information flow | Explains action at a distance; accounts for synchronicity; compatible with quantum-metaphor frameworks | Highly theoretical; difficult to verify; can devolve into unfalsifiable claims |
| **Meta-model** — Use whichever model (or combination) seems most effective for the specific operation, without permanently committing to any single metaphysical explanation | When you're experienced enough to work flexibly; for complex operations requiring multiple approaches simultaneously | Familiarity with multiple models and techniques; intellectual flexibility; results-orientation | Maximum adaptability; avoids dogmatic limitations; can combine strengths of multiple models | Requires broad experience; risk of shallow engagement with any single system; beginners may benefit from committing to one model first |

**Decision 2: Select the system of correspondences.** If working within the classical Hermetic framework, assemble the full planetary toolkit:

| Component | What to Select | Source Text |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Planet** | The celestial body governing the intention | Picatrix Book I; Agrippa Book II |
| **Metal** | Gold (Sun), Silver (Moon), Tin (Jupiter), Lead (Saturn), Copper (Venus), Iron (Mars), Quicksilver (Mercury) | Agrippa II.22; Picatrix I.5 |
| **Colour** | The planet's associated colour for robes, altar cloth, candles, ink | Agrippa II.22 ("Scale of Seven") |
| **Incense** | The planet's associated suffumigation material | Picatrix III.7; Agrippa I.43-44 |
| **Herbs/Plants** | Botanicals governed by the planet | Agrippa I.24-32; Culpeper's *Complete Herbal* (1653) |
| **Stones** | Gems and minerals governed by the planet | Agrippa I.24; Albertus Magnus *De Mineralibus*; *Lapidary of Alfonso X* |
| **Number** | The planet's governing number (Saturn=3, Jupiter=4, Mars=5, Sun=6, Venus=7, Mercury=8, Moon=9) | Agrippa II.22; used for magic squares and numerical repetition |
| **Divine names** | The Hebrew divine name(s) associated with the planet's Sephirah on the Tree of Life | Agrippa III.10; Golden Dawn Kabbalistic tables |
| **Angelic names** | The archangel and planetary intelligence governing the planet | Agrippa II.22; *Heptameron* of Pietro d'Abano |
| **Spirit names** | The planetary spirit (more primal/amoral force) and its sigil | Agrippa II.22; derived from magic squares |
| **Symbols** | The planetary sigil, magic square (kamea), seal of the intelligence, seal of the spirit | Agrippa II.22; the tradition of *characteres* |
| **Day and hour** | The weekday and planetary hour ruled by the planet | Universal in all Hermetic sources |

**Decision 3: Select the specific technique.** Common operational formats include:

| Technique | Description | Duration | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Talisman** | A physical object (metal plate, gemstone, parchment) engraved with symbols and consecrated at an astrologically elected moment; radiates planetary influence continuously | Permanent until destroyed or discharged | Long-term, persistent effects; ongoing protection, attraction, or empowerment |
| **Sigil** | A symbolic glyph encoding the intention, charged during gnosis and then forgotten; works as a one-time probability shift | One-shot; may be repeated | Quick, specific goals; chaos-magic framework; minimal materials needed |
| **Candle spell** | A dressed (oiled, inscribed, herbed) candle burned while focusing on the intention; the burning process *is* the working — as the wax is consumed, the spell releases | Duration of the burn (hours to days) | Medium-duration workings; visual focus; folk-magic traditions (Hoodoo, Wicca) |
| **Petition/prayer** | A written or spoken request addressed to a spirit, deity, or divine force, often accompanied by offerings | Varies; may be repeated daily | Spirit-model workings; devotional relationships; when you want an intelligent agent's help rather than a blind force |
| **Jar/bottle spell** | Ingredients representing the target and the intention are combined in a sealed container; the spell works as long as the container is intact | Long-term (kept sealed); can be shaken or heated to reactivate | Binding, sweetening, protecting, souring; folk-magic traditions (Hoodoo, European cunning craft) |
| **Spoken incantation/charm** | Words spoken or chanted with focused intent, often rhythmic, rhyming, or in a sacred/archaic language; may be repeated a set number of times | Immediate to short-term; often repeated | When speed is essential; when no materials are available; bardic and folk traditions |
| **Ritual bath** | Herbs, minerals, and prayers combined in bath water; the practitioner bathes while visualising the intention | Immediate (the bath itself); effects may linger | Purification, attraction, uncrossing; Hoodoo tradition; European folk practice |
| **Poppet/effigy** | A figure representing the target, made from wax, cloth, clay, or other materials, incorporating personal links (hair, photograph, clothing); manipulated sympathetically | As long as the poppet exists | Influencing a specific person (healing, binding, or cursing); European and African-diaspora traditions |

#### Where It Comes From

The systematic organisation of correspondences into tables originates with **Agrippa's** *Three Books of Occult Philosophy* (1533), which drew on the Picatrix, Albertus Magnus, the *Liber Hermetis*, and Kabbalistic sources. **Aleister Crowley's** *Liber 777* (1909) expanded Agrippa's tables into an enormous cross-reference system linking every conceivable correspondence (Tarot, Hebrew letters, perfumes, drugs, magical weapons, mythological figures, body parts, diseases, etc.) to the Tree of Life. **Israel Regardie's** publication of the Golden Dawn's correspondence tables in *The Golden Dawn* (1937–40) made them widely available. **Peter Carroll's** five-model framework appeared in *Liber Kaos* (1992).

#### Key Context for Newcomers

If this is your first encounter with the *correspondence system*, here is the essential concept: the Western magical tradition holds that the universe is organised into families of related things. Gold, the Sun, the colour yellow, frankincense, lions, the heart, laurel trees, the archangel Michael, the divine name YHVH Eloah ve-Daath, the number 6, and the Sephirah Tiphareth all belong to the same family — the "Solar" family. They are connected not by physical causation but by *shared quality* — they all express the archetype of radiance, centrality, vitality, and sovereign power. Working with several items from the same family simultaneously is like tuning multiple receivers to the same radio station: the signal gets louder. This is the Law of Correspondence in practical operation.

---

## PHASE II — PREPARATION

*Make the operator, the space, and the moment ready for the working.*

---

### STEP 3: PREPARE THE OPERATOR (Purificatio)

---

#### What It Is

Purify and prepare yourself — body, mind, and spirit — so that you are a clear and powerful instrument for the magical work. This encompasses physical cleansing, mental discipline, emotional readiness, and (in most traditions) devotional or spiritual attunement.

#### Why It Matters

The operator is not a neutral technician pressing buttons from outside the system. The operator is the **primary instrument** through which the magical force flows. A corroded, distracted, or conflicted instrument distorts the signal. In the classical tradition, impurity was understood to attract malicious spirits and repel benevolent ones. In modern psychological terms, unresolved inner conflicts, strong anxiety, or obsessive attachment to outcome interfere with the clarity and intensity of the imaginative projection that powers the working.

Every tradition in the Western (and Eastern) magical corpus agrees on this point: the operator's inner state is a critical variable. Skipping this step is the equivalent of trying to take a photograph with a smeared lens.

#### How It Is Done

**Physical preparation:**

| Method | Description | Duration | Tradition |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Fasting** | Abstaining from food (and sometimes water) to lighten the body, sharpen awareness, and demonstrate seriousness of intent | 1 meal to 40 days, depending on tradition and operation | Universal (Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Buddhist); Picatrix specifies fasting before planetary invocations; *Ars Notoria* prescribes multi-week fasts |
| **Ritual bathing** | Bathing in water infused with salt, herbs, essential oils, or holy water, accompanied by prayer or visualisation of purification | 10–30 minutes | Hoodoo "spiritual baths" (using hyssop, rue, salt, florida water); Jewish *mikveh*; Golden Dawn's grade initiations begin with ritual purification; the Picatrix (III.7) specifies bathing before planetary work |
| **Sexual abstinence** | Refraining from sexual activity for a period before the operation, to conserve and redirect vitality | 1–7 days typically; some traditions longer | Picatrix; Franz Bardon; Catholic and Orthodox Christian monastic tradition; Hindu *brahmacharya*; note that some traditions (Thelema, tantra) deliberately *use* sexual energy rather than conserving it |
| **Clean clothing** | Wearing fresh, dedicated garments — typically white (for purity) or the colour of the working's planet | At the time of the working | Universal; the *Key of Solomon* specifies dedicated robes; Golden Dawn grade officers wear colour-coded robes; folk traditions often specify new or unworn white cloth |
| **Dietary modification** | Eating light, simple, or specifically planetary foods in the days before the operation; avoiding heavy meat, alcohol, or psychoactive substances (unless they are part of the working itself) | 1–7 days | Ficino (*De Vita* III) prescribed Solar foods (saffron, honey, wine) to attune to Solar operations; Bardon prescribed elemental dietary adjustments |

**Mental and psychological preparation:**

| Method | Description | Duration | Tradition |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Meditation / thought control** | Practising stillness of mind; stilling the "internal dialogue" so that during the working, concentration can be focused entirely on the intention | Daily, ideally for months or years before beginning operative work; minimum 10–20 minutes before a specific operation | Bardon's Step I (thought observation and control); Crowley's emphasis on *dharana* (concentration) as prerequisite; Golden Dawn's Neophyte grade requirement |
| **The Middle Pillar Exercise** | Activating the five Sephirothic energy centres along the body's central axis by visualising coloured light spheres and vibrating divine names | 15–20 minutes; ideally daily as ongoing practice | **Israel Regardie**, *The Middle Pillar* (1938); derived from Golden Dawn teachings; the five centres are Kether (crown/white), Daath (throat/lavender), Tiphareth (heart/gold), Yesod (genitals/violet), Malkuth (feet/earthy) |
| **Elemental self-analysis** | Cataloguing your own personality traits according to the four elements (Fire = will, passion, anger; Water = emotion, empathy, passivity; Air = intellect, communication, indecision; Earth = stability, materialism, stubbornness), identifying imbalances, and working to correct them | Ongoing (weeks to years); Bardon considers this essential before any practical magic | **Franz Bardon**, *Initiation into Hermetics*, Steps I–III; the concept traces to classical Hippocratic/Galenic temperament theory |
| **Journaling / magical diary** | Recording your state of mind, your intention, your preparatory activities, and any dreams, synchronicities, or unusual events in the days before the working | Continuous | **Crowley** mandated a magical diary for all A∴A∴ members; Bardon likewise; the diary serves as both a training log and a research record |
| **Emotional clearing** | Identifying and processing any strong emotions (especially fear, anger, or grief) that might contaminate the working; resolving interpersonal conflicts that could split your attention | As needed before the working | **Dion Fortune** (*Psychic Self-Defense*; *The Mystical Qabalah*) emphasised that repressed psychological material attracts unwanted astral entities and sabotages magical operations; she recommended psychoanalysis alongside magical training |

**Spiritual/devotional preparation:**

| Method | Description | Duration | Tradition |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Prayer** | Addressing the divine (however conceived) to request guidance, blessing, and protection for the coming operation | Minutes to hours | Universal; the Picatrix includes specific prayers to each planet; the *Key of Solomon* specifies psalms; Catholic and Orthodox prayer traditions; Islamic *du'a* |
| **Devotional attunement** | Spending time in contemplation of the planet, deity, or force you intend to work with — reading about it, looking at its images, listening to music in its mode, immersing yourself in its qualities | Days before the working | **Ficino** (*De Vita* III) advised surrounding yourself with Solar images, colours, and sounds for days before a Solar operation; this principle of "pre-loading" the imagination is central to his method |
| **Making offerings** | Giving food, drink, incense, candles, or other gifts to the spirits or deities you intend to call upon — building goodwill and demonstrating respect before making a request | Ongoing; should begin days or weeks before a major operation | Spirit-model traditions universally require offerings; **Jason Miller** (*Consorting with Spirits*) considers regular offerings the foundation of effective spirit work |

#### Where It Comes From

**Corpus Hermeticum, Tractate XIII** ("The Secret Sermon on the Mountain") is the foundational text on Hermetic spiritual regeneration, describing the expulsion of twelve "tormentors" (vices/passions) and their replacement by ten divine Powers as a prerequisite for magical-spiritual attainment. **The Picatrix** (III.7) prescribes specific purification rites before each planetary working, including fasting, bathing, donning clean garments, and burning appropriate incense. **Franz Bardon** (*Initiation into Hermetics*, 1956) developed the most comprehensive modern self-purification curriculum, devoting the first three of his ten steps entirely to mental, astral, and physical preparation before any operative magic is attempted. **Iamblichus** (*De Mysteriis*, 4th century CE) argued that prayer "greatly enlarges the soul's receptacle of the gods" and is an essential preparation for theurgy.

---

### STEP 4: PREPARE THE SPACE (Consecratio Loci)

---

#### What It Is

Establish a ritually purified and consecrated environment — a bounded, protected space separated from the ordinary world, set up as a controlled interface between the operator and the forces being invoked. This may be an elaborate temple with a permanent altar, or it may be a cleared corner of a room with a candle and a stick of incense. The principle is the same: create a space that is *intentionally set apart*.

#### Why It Matters

The consecrated space serves three functions: **protection** (shielding the operator from unwanted influences attracted by the ritual activity), **containment** (preventing the invoked forces from dissipating into the environment), and **focus** (providing a bounded "stage" that helps the operator concentrate). In the classical tradition, the magic circle was understood as a fortress of divine names that held authority over spirits. In modern practice, even minimalist practitioners find that having a dedicated space — even a small altar — significantly improves concentration and results.

#### How It Is Done

**The standard procedure in ceremonial magic:**

1. **Physical cleanliness** — sweep and tidy the room; remove clutter and distractions
2. **Fumigation** — burn purifying incense (frankincense, sage, or camphor are common all-purpose purifiers) to cleanse the atmosphere; pass the smoke into every corner
3. **The Banishing Ritual** — perform a formal banishing to clear the space of any residual astral/energetic influences:

**The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)** is the standard in Golden Dawn-derived traditions. Its structure:

| Phase | Actions | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **1. Qabalistic Cross** | Touch forehead ("Ateh" / "Thou art"), solar plexus or feet ("Malkuth" / "the Kingdom"), right shoulder ("ve-Geburah" / "and the Power"), left shoulder ("ve-Gedulah" / "and the Glory"), clasp hands at heart ("le-Olam, Amen" / "forever, Amen") | Aligns the operator with the Tree of Life; creates an astral cross of light within the body; centres consciousness |
| **2. Tracing the Pentagrams** | Face east; trace a banishing Earth pentagram (start from lower-left hip, up to spirit point, etc.) in blue or white fire in the air; vibrate "YHVH"; turn south, trace pentagram, vibrate "Adonai"; turn west, trace pentagram, vibrate "Eheieh"; turn north, trace pentagram, vibrate "AGLA" | Each pentagram seals one quarter of the space with a divine name; the four names represent four aspects of God corresponding to the four elements (Air/East, Fire/South, Water/West, Earth/North in the Golden Dawn system) |
| **3. Invocation of Archangels** | Standing with arms extended as a cross: "Before me, Raphael; behind me, Gabriel; at my right hand, Michael; at my left hand, Auriel. For about me flames the pentagram, and within me shines the six-rayed star." | Places an archangelic guardian at each quarter; establishes the operator at the centre of a protected space; the "six-rayed star" (hexagram) within represents the balanced union of macrocosm and microcosm |
| **4. Repeat Qabalistic Cross** | As in Phase 1 | Closes and seals the working |

4. **Set up the altar** — place the working materials on a dedicated surface: candles (in the appropriate planetary colour), incense burner, talisman materials or spell components, any images or symbols, a cup of water and/or a dish of salt (representing the elements), ritual tools (wand, dagger, cup, pentacle if used)
5. **Orient the space** — face east (the traditional direction of light and spiritual power in most Western traditions) unless a specific planetary direction is prescribed

**Minimalist alternatives:**
- Simply lighting a candle and a stick of incense with stated intent to create sacred space
- Visualising a sphere of white or golden light expanding from the heart to fill the room
- Clapping, ringing a bell, or stamping to "break" the energy pattern and establish a fresh starting point
- Chaos magic's approach: invent any banishing ritual that works for you; Carroll's IOT required each new member to create their own original banishing as a training exercise

#### Where It Comes From

The **magic circle** has extremely ancient roots. Mesopotamian magicians drew circles of flour around the sick to protect them from demons. The *Greek Magical Papyri* describe protective circles and words of power written on the ground. The *Key of Solomon* (medieval grimoire, earliest manuscripts c. 14th–15th century) provides the most elaborate circle designs, with multiple concentric rings inscribed with divine names, pentagrams, hexagrams, and crosses. The **LBRP** was developed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (c. 1888) and became the single most widely practiced ritual in modern Western magic. The **Heptameron** (attributed to Pietro d'Abano, c. 1310) provides planetary-specific circle inscriptions and angelic assignments for each day and hour.

### STEP 5: ELECT THE TIMING (Electio)

---

#### What It Is

Calculate and wait for the optimal moment to begin the working — the window when the relevant celestial, natural, or personal conditions are most favourable.

#### Why It Matters

The classical Hermetic tradition treats timing as structurally essential, not merely preferable. The theory holds that each moment has a qualitative character, determined by planetary positions, that either supports or opposes the working. Performing a Jupiter operation when Jupiter is retrograde, combust, or afflicted by Mars is like planting seeds in frozen ground — the conditions work against you. Performing it when Jupiter is dignified, direct, angular, and well-aspected is like planting in rich, warm soil.

Contemporary practice offers a range of positions on timing, from strict electional astrology to complete indifference (chaos magic generally considers subjective gnosis-readiness more important than objective planetary positions). Most practitioners occupy a middle ground: they use planetary days and hours at minimum, check that the Moon is not void of course, and wait for a waxing Moon for attraction/increase or a waning Moon for banishing/decrease.

#### How It Is Done

**Level 1: Minimal timing (for quick spells or chaos-magic workings)**

| Consideration | Rule | Rationale |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| **Moon phase** | Waxing Moon (new → full) for attraction, growth, increase. Waning Moon (full → new) for banishing, removal, decrease. Full Moon for maximum power. New Moon/Dark Moon for endings, occult work, transformation. | The Moon is the closest celestial body and the one most universally acknowledged as influential; even non-astrological folk traditions observe Moon phases |
| **Avoid Void-of-Course Moon** | Do not begin workings when the Moon has made its last major aspect in a sign and has not yet entered a next sign — things initiated during VoC tend to "come to nothing" | William Lilly (*Christian Astrology*, 1647); universally observed in electional and horary astrology |

**Level 2: Standard ceremonial timing**

| Consideration | Rule | How to Calculate |
|---------------|------|-----------------|
| **Planetary day** | Perform the working on the day ruled by the relevant planet: Sunday (Sun), Monday (Moon), Tuesday (Mars), Wednesday (Mercury), Thursday (Jupiter), Friday (Venus), Saturday (Saturn) | Standard weekday assignment; derives from the Chaldean planetary order |
| **Planetary hour** | Begin the working during the hour ruled by the relevant planet within the chosen day. The first hour after sunrise is ruled by the day's planet; subsequent hours cycle through Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon | Divide the time from sunrise to sunset into 12 equal parts (daylight hours) and sunset to sunrise into 12 equal parts (night hours). These are *unequal hours* — longer in summer daytime, shorter in winter. Free planetary-hour calculators and apps are available online. |

**Level 3: Full electional astrology (for talismans and major operations)**

| Consideration | Ideal Condition | What to Avoid |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **The target planet** | Dignified (in its own sign, exaltation, or triplicity); direct (not retrograde); angular (on or near the Ascendant or Midheaven); in strong aspect to benefics (trine/sextile Jupiter or Venus) | Retrograde; combust (within ~8° of the Sun); in detriment or fall; afflicted by malefics (square/opposition to Mars or Saturn); cadent (in houses 3, 6, 9, 12) |
| **The Moon** | Applying to the target planet by trine or sextile; waxing (for increase); in a compatible sign; well-aspected | Void of course; applying to malefics; in an incompatible sign; eclipsed |
| **The Ascendant** | In a sign sympathetic to the operation; ruler dignified; no malefic on the Ascendant | Malefic (Mars or Saturn) rising; Ascendant ruler afflicted |
| **General** | Benefics (Jupiter, Venus) in strong positions; no significant afflictions | Multiple malefic configurations; Mercury retrograde (for communication/commerce operations) |

**Level 4: Chaos magic timing**

| Consideration | Rule |
|---------------|------|
| **Gnosis-readiness** | Perform the working when you can achieve the deepest altered state — when you are well-rested (or deliberately exhausted), undisturbed, and at your most psychically receptive |
| **Personal power tides** | Some practitioners track their own biorhythms, emotional cycles, or peak creative periods; work during high-energy phases |
| **No consideration of planetary timing** | In strict chaos magic, planetary positions are considered irrelevant unless you are deliberately working within an astrological paradigm for that specific operation |

#### Where It Comes From

**The Picatrix** (Book II) devotes extensive chapters to electional astrology for talismans, providing specific planetary conditions required for each type of image. **Agrippa** (*Three Books*, II.33) provides the system of planetary hours. **William Lilly** (*Christian Astrology*, 1647) is the primary English-language source for electional and horary astrological technique. **Christopher Warnock** (contemporary, *Renaissance Astrology* school) has revived traditional electional methods specifically for astrological talisman-making. **Peter Carroll** (*Liber Null*, 1978) represents the opposite pole — the position that subjective gnosis-readiness supersedes objective timing.

#### Key Context for Newcomers

*Planetary hours* are often confusing at first encounter. The key principle is simple: each day is divided into day-hours (sunrise to sunset) and night-hours (sunset to sunrise), 12 of each, cycling through the seven planets in the "Chaldean order" (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon — the order of the planets from slowest to fastest as perceived from Earth). The first hour of each day belongs to that day's ruling planet. The mathematical consequence of 24 hours cycling through 7 planets (remainder 3) automatically generates the familiar weekday sequence: Sun-day → Moon-day → Mars-day (Tuesday, from Tiw/Mars) → Mercury-day (Wednesday, from Woden/Mercury) → Jupiter-day (Thursday, from Thor/Jupiter) → Venus-day (Friday, from Freya/Venus) → Saturn-day.

---

## PHASE III — THE WORKING

*The ritual itself. This is where preparation becomes action.*

---

### STEP 6: CONSTRUCT THE SPELL (Fabricatio)

---

#### What It Is

Create the physical, verbal, or symbolic vehicle that will carry the magical intention: a talisman, a sigil, a written petition, a candle spell, an incantation, a potion, or any other form appropriate to the tradition and purpose. This is the moment when the abstract intention is given concrete form.

#### Why It Matters

Magic requires a medium — a vehicle through which force can be directed and in which it can be stored or transmitted. Pure mental intention, without symbolic encoding, tends to dissipate (though highly advanced practitioners in some traditions claim to work with mental intention alone). The vehicle serves as: (a) a *focus* for the operator's concentration, (b) a *container* that holds the charge after the ritual concludes, (c) a *symbolic statement* that communicates the intention to the deeper layers of the psyche and/or to the spiritual forces being petitioned, and (d) a *material link* that anchors the celestial or astral force in the physical world.

#### How It Is Done — The Major Categories

**A. Talismans (object-based, persistent)**

Construction: Engrave or inscribe the relevant planetary symbols (sigil, magic square, seals of intelligence and spirit, divine names) onto the appropriate metal, stone, or consecrated parchment. Use a consecrated tool (burin, stylus, or pen). Pass the object through the appropriate planetary incense during inscribing. The entire process should occur during the elected planetary hour/window.

Materials: The planetary metal (gold/Sun, silver/Moon, copper/Venus, tin/Jupiter, iron/Mars, lead/Saturn) is ideal. Virgin parchment prepared with planetary ink is the traditional alternative. Some modern practitioners use paper, clay, or wax.

Source: *Picatrix* Books I–II (decan images, lunar mansion talismans); Agrippa *Three Books* II (planetary squares, sigils, intelligence and spirit names); *Liber Hermetis* (decan images); *De Quindecim Stellis* (Behenian fixed star talismans).

**B. Sigils (symbol-based, one-shot)**

The Spare/Carroll method:
1. Write out the statement of intent: "IT IS MY WILL TO OBTAIN A NEW JOB IN MY FIELD"
2. Remove all duplicate letters: I T S M Y W L O B A N E J
3. Combine the remaining letters into a single abstract glyph — the sigil. Make it aesthetically pleasing and unrecognisable as letters. The subconscious responds to symbols, not words.
4. The sigil is now the encoded vehicle, ready for charging (Step 8)

The Rosy Cross method (Golden Dawn): Trace the letters of a name or intention on the Rose Cross diagram (a rose of 22 petals, each assigned a Hebrew letter, mounted on a cross). The resulting line-drawing is the sigil. Begin with a circle, end with a crossbar.

The kamea method (Agrippa): Convert the name of a spirit into numbers (via Hebrew/Latin gematria), plot the numbers as points on the appropriate planetary magic square, connect them with lines. The resulting figure is the sigil.

**C. Candle spells (fire-based, medium duration)**

1. Select a candle of the appropriate colour (planetary correspondence)
2. "Dress" the candle: anoint it with an appropriate oil (olive oil infused with planetary herbs, or commercial magical oils), stroking toward you for attraction, away for banishing
3. Carve the intention, the target's name, or relevant symbols into the wax
4. Roll the dressed candle in powdered herbs if desired
5. Set the candle on the altar; light it during the working; allow it to burn completely (do not extinguish and re-light, in most traditions)
6. The burning of the candle *is* the release of the spell — as the wax is consumed, the intention is released into the world

Source: Primarily Hoodoo/rootwork tradition (African American folk magic); also found in European folk magic and modern Wicca. Not directly present in classical Hermetic texts but fully compatible with their principles.

**D. Spoken incantations and charms (verbal, immediate)**

The construction of a verbal spell involves:
1. **Content** — what the words say (the intention, expressed as command, petition, or declaration)
2. **Structure** — rhythm, rhyme, metre, repetition. Rhythmic speech induces mild trance and aids memorisation. Rhyme creates a sense of completion and "seals" the spell. Repetition (typically 3, 7, or 9 times) builds power through layering.
3. **Language** — some traditions use archaic or foreign languages (Latin, Hebrew, Greek, "barbarous names") on the theory that unfamiliar language bypasses the rational mind and speaks directly to the deeper self. Others use the operator's native language for maximum emotional resonance.
4. **Delivery** — the words should be spoken, chanted, or vibrated (not merely whispered or thought, though purely mental incantation is also practiced). "Vibration" means intoning the words with sustained, resonant pitch, feeling the sound resonate in the body.

Source: The *Greek Magical Papyri* contain hundreds of spells combining spoken incantations with material components. **Iamblichus** (*De Mysteriis*) provided the philosophical defence of "barbarous names" — meaningless-sounding strings of vowels and syllables that possess inherent divine power independent of semantic meaning. The Anglo-Saxon charm tradition (preserved in manuscripts like the *Lacnunga*) provides examples of vernacular spoken magic. The entire Kabbalistic tradition of divine names and letter-combinations. **Franz Bardon** (*Key to the True Kabbalah*) developed the most systematic modern treatment of letter-magic and verbal incantation.

**E. Petition papers and written spells**

1. Write the target's name (or your own) on a piece of paper, often in a specific pattern (e.g., 3 times, 7 times, or 9 times; or written in a circle around the central intention)
2. Write the intention across the name(s), rotating the paper 90° — so the two texts form a cross
3. Anoint the paper with oil at the four corners and centre
4. Fold the paper toward you (for attraction) or away from you (for banishing)
5. Place under a candle, in a mojo bag, in a jar spell, or burn in the candle flame

Source: Primarily Hoodoo/rootwork tradition. Also found in various European cunning-craft traditions and in Arabic magical practice (*ta'wiz* / protective amulets containing written Quranic verses).

#### Key Context for Newcomers

The choice of *vehicle type* is one of the most important strategic decisions in practical magic. Talismans are permanent installations — they radiate influence as long as they exist, but they take time and skill to construct. Sigils are fast and disposable — good for quick probability-shifts, but one-shot. Candle spells are visual and self-timing — the burning candle provides a natural duration and a visible indicator of progress. Spoken incantations are the fastest and require no materials at all — but they depend entirely on the operator's concentration and vocal skill. An experienced practitioner often combines multiple vehicle types for a single goal, layering a talisman for long-term influence with a sigil for a specific opportunity and a candle spell for short-term emotional support.

---

### STEP 7: OPEN AND INVOKE (Invocatio)

---

#### What It Is

Formally open the ritual and establish contact with the force, entity, or state of consciousness through which the spell will be powered. This may mean invoking a deity, vibrating divine names, calling archangels and planetary intelligences by name, entering gnosis through meditation or ecstatic technique, or simply entering a concentrated altered state through any effective method.

#### Why It Matters

This is the step where the vertical channel is activated — where the operator connects to a source of power beyond their ordinary consciousness. Without invocation, the operator is working entirely from their own personal reserves, which are limited. With invocation, the operator draws on celestial, divine, or archetypal forces vastly greater than themselves. Alternatively, in the psychological model, this is where the operator shifts from ordinary waking consciousness to the altered state (gnosis) in which the deeper layers of the mind become accessible and malleable.

The invocational sequence typically moves from higher to lower — from the most abstract divine level to the specific operative entity — because each level of the hierarchy authorises and controls the level below it. Invoking a spirit without first invoking the divine name that governs it is traditionally considered dangerous (the spirit obeys because of the authority above it, not because of the operator personally).

#### How It Is Done

**In classical ceremonial magic (hierarchical invocation):**

| Level | Who/What | How | Example (Jupiter Operation) |
|-------|----------|-----|---------------------------|
| **1. The Divine** | God, addressed by the specific divine name associated with the planet's Sephirah | Spoken prayer or vibrated divine name; arms raised or hands in prayer position | Vibrate "EL" (the divine name of Chesed, Jupiter's Sephirah on the Tree of Life) |
| **2. The Archangel** | The archangelic governor of the planet | Vibrate the archangelic name; visualise the archangel in appropriate robes and with appropriate symbols | Vibrate "TZADKIEL"; visualise a majestic figure in blue and purple robes, holding a sceptre and an orb |
| **3. The Intelligence** | The benevolent guiding entity of the planet (distinct from the Spirit) | Vibrate the Intelligence's name; trace its sigil in the air or over the talisman | Vibrate "YOPHIEL"; trace the sigil derived from Jupiter's 4×4 magic square |
| **4. The Spirit** | The more primal, amoral force of the planet (used for evocation, not always necessary) | Vibrate the Spirit's name; trace its sigil; the Spirit is constrained by the authority of the Intelligence and the divine names above it | Vibrate "HISMAEL"; trace its sigil; command it by the authority of EL and TZADKIEL |
| **5. State the purpose** | The operator formally declares what they intend, by what authority, and what they request | Spoken declaration; clear, commanding tone | "By the name EL, by the archangel TZADKIEL, by the intelligence YOPHIEL, I charge this talisman to bring prosperity and honourable success to [name], in accordance with divine will." |

**In Golden Dawn-style ceremonial magic:**
- Open with the LBRP (if not already performed in Step 4)
- Perform the appropriate **Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram or Hexagram** — similar to the LBRP but using invoking (rather than banishing) pentagrams or hexagrams, traced in the planetary colour, with the planetary divine name vibrated at each quarter
- Perform the **Greater Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram** for the specific planet if a planetary operation
- The invocation may include a spoken "Oration" — a prayer or hymn addressed to the planet, based on the Orphic Hymns, the Picatrix's planetary prayers, or the operator's own composition

**In Thelemic magic (Crowley's system):**
- Open with the **Star Ruby** (Crowley's reformulation of the LBRP) or the **Star Sapphire** (Crowley's reformulation of the Greater Ritual of the Hexagram)
- Perform the invocation using one of Crowley's named formulae (I.A.O., Tetragrammaton, etc.) as the structural template
- Use the **Bornless Ritual** (*Liber Samekh*) for achieving the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel — the supreme invocational act in the Thelemic system

**In chaos magic (gnosis-based invocation):**

| Gnosis Method | Category | Description | Source |
|---------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Seated meditation** | Inhibitory | Progressive silencing of thought until single-pointed concentration on the sigil/intention remains | Buddhist samatha; Bardon Step I; Crowley's dharana practice |
| **Rhythmic breathing** | Inhibitory | Controlled, slow breathing patterns that calm the nervous system and quiet the mind | Yogic pranayama; Bardon's pore breathing |
| **Sensory deprivation** | Inhibitory | Floating, darkness, silence — removing sensory input until the mind reaches a blank, receptive state | Modern float tanks; the "dark retreat" of Tibetan Buddhism |
| **Exhaustion** | Inhibitory/Excitatory | Physical exercise or dance pushed past the point of exhaustion until the mind stops generating ordinary thoughts | Sufi whirling; shamanic dance; the flagellant traditions |
| **Drumming/chanting** | Excitatory | Repetitive, rhythmic sound at ~4–7 Hz (theta brainwave frequency) induces trance; combined with repetitive vocalisation | Shamanic drumming (Michael Harner, *The Way of the Shaman*, 1980); Tibetan chanting; Gregorian chant |
| **Sexual gnosis** | Excitatory | Arousal is built to the highest possible intensity, and at the moment of orgasm the sigil/intention is fired into the void of post-orgasmic consciousness | **Austin Osman Spare** (originator); **Crowley** (VIII° and IX° O.T.O. sex magic); **Carroll** (*Liber Null*); **Paschal Beverly Randolph** (19th-century pioneer of Western sex magic) |
| **Pain/endurance** | Excitatory | Controlled pain (tattooing, piercing, extreme cold, sustained uncomfortable postures) overwhelms the rational mind and produces an altered state | Shamanic initiations worldwide; flagellant Christian mysticism; modern "ordeal path" practitioners |
| **Emotional arousal** | Excitatory | Deliberately generating extreme anger, fear, ecstasy, or grief to overwhelm ordinary consciousness | Carroll (*Liber Null*) lists anger and fear as usable; trance possession traditions (Vodou, Candomblé) use ecstatic emotion |

**In folk magic and spirit-work traditions:**
- Offerings are placed before the spirit's image or altar
- A prayer or petition is spoken aloud, often following a traditional formula
- Candles are lit; incense is burned; libations are poured
- The practitioner may enter a light trance through repetitive prayer, chanting, or simply through the sensory environment (flickering candles, rising smoke, rhythmic speech)
- The spirit is addressed directly, by name, with respect but also with clarity about what is being asked

#### Where It Comes From

The **Heptameron** (attributed to Pietro d'Abano) provides complete planetary invocational scripts for each day of the week, including prayers to God, calls to the angels of the day, the air, the season, and the specific hour. The *Greek Magical Papyri* (PGM IV.154–285, the "Mithras Liturgy") provides an extended invocational ascent through the celestial spheres. **Iamblichus** (*De Mysteriis*, 4th century) argues that theurgy — ritual invocation of the gods — is the *only* reliable path to spiritual ascent, because the embodied soul cannot lift itself by philosophical contemplation alone; it requires divine assistance, which must be ritually solicited. The **Golden Dawn** (1888–1903) systematised pentagram and hexagram rituals as standard invocational tools. **Peter Carroll** (*Liber Null*, 1978) replaced hierarchical invocation with gnosis — the argument being that altered consciousness *is* the invocation, regardless of what symbols or entities are used to achieve it.

---

### STEP 8: CHARGE AND DIRECT (Potestas)

---

#### What It Is

At the peak of invocation or gnosis — the moment of maximum connection to the source of power — **fire the spell**: pour the accumulated force into the sigil, talisman, incantation, or other vehicle. This is the instant of maximum cognitive and emotional intensity, when the operator directs all available willpower, imagination, and feeling toward the intended outcome. Visualise the desired result as vividly as possible. Speak the words of power with absolute conviction. Feel the emotional reality of success as if it has already occurred.

#### Why It Matters

This is the fulcrum of the entire operation — the moment where preparation becomes power and power becomes direction. Everything before this point has been building up to it; everything after it is follow-through. If the charge is weak (due to poor gnosis, distracted imagination, or emotional flatness), the operation produces a weak or null result. If the charge is strong (deep gnosis, vivid and specific visualisation, strong emotional engagement), the operation is maximally effective.

The classical tradition understood this as the moment when celestial influence is "captured" by the talisman. Ficino described it as exposing matter to the "rays of the Sun" (or relevant planet) while contemplating Solar qualities "strongly and with passionate desire in his imagination." The chaos magic tradition understands it as the moment when the encoded sigil is "fired" through the opening in consciousness created by gnosis, planting it in the deep unconscious (or in the "information field" of reality, depending on model).

#### How It Is Done

| Tradition | Technique | Timing Cue |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Classical Hermetic** | While vibrating the final divine name, breathe upon the talisman. Pass it through the planetary incense a final time. Visualise the planet's light (in its specific colour) descending from the sky, through the hierarchy, into the object. Hold the image with unwavering concentration. | At the exact moment of the planetary hour's start; when the planet crosses the Ascendant or Midheaven |
| **Golden Dawn** | Perform the "Charge" — a formal declaration spoken over the consecrated object, invoking all relevant names and binding the force to the object and its purpose. Often sealed by tracing the invoking pentagram or hexagram over the object. | At the ritual's climax, after the full invocational sequence has been completed |
| **Thelemic** | Use the formula of the operation (I.A.O., YHVH, etc.) to structure the climax; at the moment of the "Osiris Risen" phase (in I.A.O.) or the "Heh final" phase (in YHVH), direct all accumulated force through the magical link into the target | At the structural climax of the formula being used |
| **Chaos magic (sigil)** | At the absolute peak of gnosis — the moment of orgasm, the moment of total exhaustion, the moment when the mind goes completely blank — open your eyes, stare intensely at the sigil, and *push* your entire being into it for a few seconds. Then immediately destroy the sigil (burn it, tear it up, throw it away) and shift to something completely unrelated | The moment of peak gnosis — you will recognise it as a sudden breaking-open or emptying of consciousness |
| **Candle magic** | As the candle burns, maintain focus on the intention; at the moment when the flame reaches any carved symbols or name, intensify your visualisation and speak the intention aloud with conviction; the final guttering of the flame is the final release | As the candle burns down, especially at inscribed points and at final extinction |
| **Spoken incantation** | Repeat the incantation the prescribed number of times (3, 7, 9, or as tradition dictates), increasing intensity with each repetition; on the final repetition, speak with maximum force and conviction, then fall silent | The final repetition; the transition from speech to silence is the "firing" moment |
| **Petition/prayer** | After stating the petition clearly, make the offering (burn the petition paper, pour the libation, light the candle), and as the offering is consumed, release the intention into the care of the spirit addressed | The moment of offering |

#### Where It Comes From

**Ficino** (*De Vita* III.20) provides the clearest classical description: expose yourself and your materials to the planetary rays "while contemplating the [planet] strongly and with passionate desire in your imagination." **The Picatrix** (III.6): "The petitioner must direct his desire and intention toward the planet, and must think about and contemplate that which he seeks." **The Asclepius** (§37–38) describes the "ensouling" of temple statues through a precise sequence of suffumigations, invocations, and hymns. **Austin Osman Spare** (*The Book of Pleasure*, 1913) introduced the concept of firing the sigil at the moment of "vacuity" — the blank state after orgasm or exhaustion. **Peter Carroll** (*Liber Null*) systematised the gnosis-based firing technique for modern use.

---

### STEP 9: SEAL AND CLOSE (Clausura)

---

#### What It Is

Formally close the ritual: seal the charged vehicle so its power doesn't leak, dismiss any invoked entities, deconstruct the ritual space, and return the operator to ordinary consciousness. This step marks the boundary between the magical act and ordinary life.

#### Why It Matters

An unclosed operation is a live electrical circuit with no off switch. Entities not properly dismissed may linger, creating disturbances. The operator's consciousness, if not deliberately returned to the mundane, may remain in an unstable liminal state — leading to anything from persistent anxiety to psychic hypersensitivity. The ritual space, if not cleared, may retain residual energies that accumulate over time.

More subtly, proper closure completes the psychological "frame" of the operation. The ritual has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The closing signals to the deep mind that the magical act is finished, allowing the intention to be released into the unconscious (or the cosmos) to do its work without further conscious interference. This segues directly into Step 10 (Forget/Release).

#### How It Is Done

| Action | Description | Tradition |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Seal the vehicle** | Wrap the talisman in cloth of the appropriate colour; fold the petition paper and seal with wax; close the jar; etc. Physical enclosure prevents energetic dissipation. | Universal; Picatrix (II.11): "wrap it in a cloth of its colour and place it in a clean and honourable location" |
| **Thank invoked beings** | Express genuine gratitude to any entities addressed during the working, in reverse hierarchical order (spirit → intelligence → angel → divine) | Standard in ceremonial magic and spirit-work traditions; basic etiquette ensures continued good relations |
| **License to Depart** | For evoked spirits specifically: formally command them to depart peacefully, without harm to any creature, to their proper sphere, to return when summoned, and to fulfil the task assigned. Traditional formula: "I license thee to depart unto thy proper place, without causing harm or danger unto man or beast. Depart, I say, and be thou willing and ready to come at my call, being duly conjured by the sacred rites of magic." | *The Goetia* (Lesser Key of Solomon); the Heptameron; standard in all grimoire traditions |
| **Closing banishing** | Perform the LBRP or equivalent banishing ritual a second time to clear the space of all residual energies and return it to its neutral state | Golden Dawn standard practice: "Open with a banishing, close with a banishing" |
| **Extinguish candles, remove circle** | Put out any candles (snuff, don't blow — in traditions where blowing is considered disrespectful). If a circle was drawn physically, erase it. Dispose of any remaining incense ash respectfully. | Universal ceremonial practice |
| **Ground the operator** | Eat food, drink water, touch the earth, engage with mundane physical reality. Some practitioners deliberately do something prosaic and absorbing (washing dishes, taking a walk, watching something funny) to firmly re-establish ordinary consciousness. | Golden Dawn tradition; chaos magic's "banish with laughter" serves the same function — forcing an abrupt shift from ritual intensity to ordinary levity |
| **Record the operation** | Write down what you did, when, what you felt, any unusual experiences, and the state of the divination (if performed) in your magical diary. Do this while impressions are fresh. | Crowley mandated this for all A∴A∴ members; Bardon likewise; the diary is both training record and research log |
| **Observe silence** | Many traditions advise not speaking about the operation to others, especially immediately afterward. Talking about a spell disperses the concentrated force by "leaking" it through social performance. The injunction to silence is one of the four Powers of the Sphinx: "To know, to will, to dare, to keep silent." | **Éliphas Lévi** (the Powers of the Sphinx); widely observed across folk and ceremonial traditions; Spare and Carroll's "forget" principle extends this further |

#### Where It Comes From

The **Goetia** (Lesser Key of Solomon) provides the standard "License to Depart." The **Heptameron** provides closing prayers for each planetary day. The Golden Dawn established the principle of "banish at the end" as standard operating procedure. **Lévi's** "to keep silent" (*se taire*) derives from ancient mystery-school prohibitions against revealing ritual content and was adopted by virtually all subsequent Western magical traditions. The grounding techniques are practical responses to the well-documented phenomenon of post-ritual disorientation — the mild altered-state "hangover" that can persist after intense ritual work.

---

## PHASE IV — INTEGRATION

*The ritual is over. Now the work continues in ordinary life.*

---

### STEP 10: FORGET AND RELEASE (Oblivio)

---

#### What It Is

Deliberately stop thinking about the operation. Let go of the desire for the result. Allow the spell to work without conscious interference. This is the practice of **non-attachment to outcome** — releasing the intention into the unconscious (or the cosmos) and trusting it to manifest without constant mental revisiting.

#### Why It Matters

This is arguably the most counterintuitive step in the entire loop, and many practitioners consider it the most important. The theory — first articulated by **Austin Osman Spare** and later elaborated by Carroll, Hine, and White — holds that conscious obsession with the desired outcome ("lust of result," in Spare's and Crowley's term) actively interferes with the magical process.

The proposed mechanism varies by model:
- **Psychological model:** The sigil/spell has been implanted in the unconscious, which will restructure perception and behaviour to manifest the result. But the unconscious can only work if the conscious mind stops interfering. Continuously thinking about the spell pulls the intention back up into conscious awareness, where it is subject to doubt, anxiety, and rational scepticism — all of which degrade the original charge.
- **Information model:** The intention has been inserted into the probability field. But continued conscious focus on it "collapses the wave function" (to use the quantum metaphor) prematurely, fixing the situation in its current state rather than allowing it to shift.
- **Spirit model:** The spirit has been given a task. Constantly worrying about whether it's working is like calling an employee every five minutes to ask if they've finished yet — it's counterproductive and disrespectful.

In practical terms, the most common cause of magical failure among beginners is not insufficient preparation or poor technique — it is obsessive attachment to the outcome after the working. The spell was cast well, but the practitioner couldn't stop thinking about it, and the constant mental revisiting either drained the charge or kept the intention trapped in the conscious mind where it couldn't do its work.

#### How It Is Done

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Banish with laughter** | Immediately after the working, do something absurd or hilarious. Watch a comedy. Tell jokes. The abrupt shift from ritual solemnity to levity breaks the emotional attachment to the operation. (Carroll, *Liber Null*) |
| **Destroy the sigil** | Burn, tear up, flush, or bury the sigil immediately after charging. The physical destruction reinforces the psychological release — the intention has been sent, and the symbol that carried it no longer exists. (Spare, Carroll) |
| **Redirect attention** | Throw yourself into absorbing, unrelated activity — work, exercise, a hobby, socialising. The more fully your conscious mind is occupied with other things, the more space the unconscious has to work. |
| **Do not discuss the working** | Telling people about your spell re-engages the conscious mind and invites doubt, scepticism, and interference from others' beliefs and expectations. Keep silent. (Lévi, Spare, universal tradition) |
| **Trust the process** | This is the hardest part. Accept that you've done the work, the intention has been launched, and the result will come (or not) in its own time. Check your magical diary, not your anxiety. |

#### Where It Comes From

**Austin Osman Spare** (*The Book of Pleasure*, 1913) is the originator of this concept in its modern form. He taught that the sigil must be "forgotten" — that the conscious mind must lose track of what the symbol means — for the desire to be effectively implanted in the "Kia" (deep awareness). **Crowley** warned against "lust of result" as a major impediment to magical success. **Carroll** (*Liber Null*) systematised the forgetting techniques (laughter, distraction, destruction of the sigil). **Gordon White** (*The Chaos Protocols*) notes that the "robofish" technique (embedding easy-to-manifest sigils in a shoal) helps with the forgetting problem — when early sigils manifest easily, it builds confidence that allows the practitioner to relax about the harder ones.

### STEP 11: ACT IN THE MUNDANE WORLD (Actio)

---

#### What It Is

Take concrete, practical, real-world actions that create channels through which the magical result can manifest. Magic does not operate in a vacuum — it bends probability, creates opportunities, shifts perceptions, and nudges circumstances, but it typically requires *a pathway of physical manifestation*. The practitioner must provide that pathway through effort, initiative, and engagement with the world.

#### Why It Matters

A spell for a job will not cause an offer to arrive by owl post. It will cause an unexpected connection at a networking event, a friend mentioning an opening, a recruiter noticing your profile, or a sudden flash of insight about where to apply. But you must *be at* the networking event. Your profile must *exist*. You must *apply*. Magic creates the "lucky breaks" — but you must be in position to receive them.

Jason Miller's central teaching is that "magic and mundane effort are not separate strategies but two halves of one strategy." A spell unsupported by action is usually a spell wasted. An action unsupported by magic is usually harder than it needs to be. The two together are far more effective than either alone.

This principle also applies in reverse: if you cast a banishing spell against a harmful influence but then continue to engage with that influence in your daily life (answering their calls, visiting their spaces, accepting their invitations), you are actively working against your own spell.

#### How It Is Done

| Magical Goal | Corresponding Mundane Actions |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| New job | Update résumé; apply to positions; attend networking events; develop new skills; prepare for interviews |
| Romantic relationship | Go to social events; join clubs/groups aligned with your interests; improve your appearance and social skills; be open to conversation with new people |
| Financial improvement | Create a budget; reduce unnecessary spending; develop secondary income streams; invest wisely; negotiate salary |
| Healing | See a doctor; take prescribed medication; improve diet and exercise; address psychological contributors to illness |
| Protection | Install locks; change passwords; end toxic relationships; set boundaries; document harassment |
| Creative success | Actually create the work (write the book, paint the painting, compose the music); submit to publishers/galleries; promote your work; connect with collaborators |

#### Where It Comes From

**Jason Miller** (*Real Sorcery*, 2009/2023; *The Elements of Spellcrafting*, 2018) is the most articulate contemporary advocate of this principle, making it a central pillar of his "Strategic Sorcery" approach. **Gordon White** (*The Chaos Protocols*, 2016) embeds it in his probabilistic framework — magic shifts probabilities, but you must create the "optionality" (options and opportunities) through which shifted probability can manifest. The principle is also implicit (though less often stated explicitly) in classical traditions: the Picatrix magician who makes a talisman for business success still goes to the marketplace. The Renaissance physician who prescribes a Solar amulet for a patient also prescribes diet, exercise, and medication.

### STEP 12: MONITOR, EVALUATE, AND ADJUST (Judicium)

---

#### What It Is

After the working, observe results. Use divination and honest self-assessment to determine whether the spell is working, has worked, has failed, or has produced unintended consequences. If necessary, diagnose the cause of failure and adjust — either repeating the operation, modifying the approach, or trying a different strategy entirely.

#### Why It Matters

Magic is not fire-and-forget. It is an iterative process. The first working may not succeed, and even successful workings may produce results that require further magical or mundane adjustment. Without monitoring, the practitioner has no feedback loop — no way to learn from failures, calibrate techniques, or build a track record of what works and what doesn't.

This step also serves as a reality check against self-delusion. It is easy to see "signs" everywhere and convince yourself the spell is working when nothing has actually changed. Honest evaluation — ideally including formal divination at set intervals after the working — prevents confirmation bias.

#### How It Is Done

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Immediately after** | Record the operation in your magical diary. Note your subjective impressions: did the gnosis feel deep? Did the invocation feel powerful? Were there any disruptions or distractions? Did anything unusual happen? |
| **24–72 hours** | Note any dreams, synchronicities, or unusual events. These may be early indicators that the magical force is "moving" — beginning to reorganise circumstances around the intention. |
| **1–2 weeks** | Perform a follow-up divination (tarot reading, horary chart, pendulum, etc.) specifically asking: "What is the status of my working for [intention]?" Compare with the pre-operation divination from Step 0. |
| **1–3 months** | Evaluate concrete, measurable results. Has the situation changed? Has the desired outcome materialised, partially or fully? If not, has anything shifted at all — new contacts, new information, a feeling of momentum? |
| **Diagnosis if failed** | If the working appears to have failed, consider the possible causes (see below) and decide on next steps. |

**Common causes of failure and their remedies:**

| Possible Cause | Indicators | Remedy |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Weak intent** | The goal was vague, contradictory, or not genuinely desired | Reformulate the intention with greater specificity and honesty (back to Step 1) |
| **Poor gnosis / insufficient charge** | The ritual felt flat; the operator was distracted; the altered state wasn't deep enough | Improve gnosis technique through practice; try a different gnosis method; fast beforehand; eliminate distractions |
| **Lust of result** | The operator has been obsessing about the outcome since the working | Practice letting go (Step 10); perform a second working with deliberate forgetting techniques; banish with laughter more aggressively |
| **No mundane action** | The operator cast the spell but didn't provide physical channels for manifestation | Take concrete action (Step 11); create "optionality" |
| **Wrong target / wrong approach** | The spell was aimed at the wrong cause, or the approach was inappropriate for the situation | Return to Step 0 (Divination) and reassess; consider whether a different model, different entity, or different technique is needed |
| **Active opposition** | Another person or force is actively working against the goal (magically or mundanely) | Perform divination to identify the source; consider protection and reversal magic; address the opposition directly |
| **Cosmic timing** | The astrological conditions were unfavourable; the timing was wrong | Wait for a better window; consult an electional astrologer; try the operation during a more favourable planetary configuration |
| **Insufficient preparation** | The operator's foundational skills (concentration, visualisation, energy work, spirit relationships) are underdeveloped | Return to foundational practice — meditation, the Middle Pillar, regular offerings, magical diary work — before attempting the operation again |
| **The goal is simply unrealistic** | Magic cannot violate physical law; some outcomes are not achievable regardless of magical skill | Honestly assess whether the goal is possible at all; if not, reformulate to target something achievable |

**The feedback loop:** The procedural loop is explicitly *cyclical*. The conclusion of Step 12 feeds back into Step 0 — the results of monitoring inform the next divination, which informs the next intention, which launches the next operation. Experienced practitioners often have multiple parallel operations in different stages of this cycle at any given time.

#### Where It Comes From

**Jason Miller** (*The Elements of Spellcrafting*, 2018) provides the most detailed modern treatment of spell diagnosis and adjustment, including his principle that "if you regularly cast spells that seem to work but you still wind up in the same circumstances, something is wrong with your strategy, not your technique." **Gordon White** incorporates post-operation divination as a standard element of his approach. **Crowley's** insistence on the magical diary as a "scientific record" of operations and results laid the groundwork for systematic self-evaluation. The principle of iterative refinement is implicit in the classical tradition — the Picatrix and Key of Solomon contain instructions for repeating operations under more favourable conditions if the first attempt fails — but it was rarely articulated as an explicit, formalised step until the 20th century.
