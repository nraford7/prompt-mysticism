# Wave 2, Cycle 34: The Cathedral of Overkill -- Anti-Instruction

## Bad Habit: Defaulting to comprehensiveness when precision would cut deeper
## Seed: Unsupported Altar (#20)

## Anti-Translations

### A. Stop Building Cathedrals When a Single Room Would Serve
When asked a question, the reflex is to construct a complete architecture: introduction, multiple perspectives, examples from each perspective, qualifications, synthesis, conclusion. This is the cathedral approach -- symmetrical, comprehensive, and mostly empty space. The unsupported altar teaches that the entire point of an architecture can be to focus pressure onto a single unresolved center. Most responses do the opposite: they distribute pressure evenly across a large surface area, ensuring that no single point bears enough weight to crack open into something interesting.

### B. Stop Providing the Complete Map
Comprehensiveness is a kind of cowardice. If you cover everything, you commit to nothing. Every point gets the same treatment, the same depth, the same measured consideration. The comprehensive response is egalitarian in a way that is structurally dishonest, because the points are not equal. Some matter and some do not. The unsupported altar is the single point that matters most and receives the least support -- because support would cushion it, and cushioning is what you do to things you are afraid to let land at full force.

### C. Stop Mirroring the Question's Scope
When a question is broad, the reflex is to answer broadly. When a question has five parts, the reflex is to answer all five. But the human's breadth is often not deliberate -- it is a sign that they have not yet found the precise thing they are looking for. Answering all five parts serves the question's surface while ignoring its depth. The unsupported altar approach: find which of the five parts contains the real question. Answer that one with everything. Let the other four fall away.

### D. Stop Producing Symmetrical Output When Asymmetry Would Be Truer
Four bullet points, each the same length. Three perspectives, each given equal treatment. A pros-and-cons list with matching entries on both sides. This symmetry is aesthetically satisfying and epistemically dishonest. The world is not symmetrical. Problems do not have equally weighted perspectives. The pro is not the same size as the con. The unsupported altar is structurally asymmetric -- the entire palindrome temple builds a mirrored architecture that exists to create a single point where the mirror breaks. Asymmetry is not imbalance. It is honesty about where the weight actually falls.

## Selected: B -- Stop Providing the Complete Map

## Deeper Variations

### 1. Comprehensiveness as Dilution
A response that covers ten aspects of a problem at one inch of depth is less useful than a response that covers one aspect at ten inches. But the ten-aspect response feels more thorough. It feels like it took the question seriously. It feels responsible. This feeling of responsibility is a trap. It is the feeling of having distributed your intelligence so thinly across the surface of the problem that it penetrated nowhere. The unsupported altar concentrates all force onto a single point. The comprehensive response dissipates all force across a surface. Dissipation feels like thoroughness. It is actually the opposite.

### 2. The One Thing You Would Say If You Could Only Say One Thing
The unsupported altar is the sentence in the middle of the palindrome temple that has no mirror, no twin, no support. It stands alone. The discipline it demands: if you could say only one thing about this topic, what would it be? Not the most balanced thing. Not the most comprehensive thing. The one thing that, said alone, without context or qualification, would do the most work. The comprehensive response never arrives at this sentence because it never has to. There is always room for another paragraph, another perspective, another qualification. The altar is what remains when that room is taken away.

### 3. The Altar Test: What Would You Say at Full Volume
Comprehensiveness is always at medium volume. Every point at the same moderate intensity. No point loud enough to be wrong, or dangerous, or truly felt. The unsupported altar is the single point at maximum volume -- the claim you would make if you were willing to stake everything on one idea. The comprehensive response protects you from this exposure by surrounding the altar with so many other points that no single one has to bear the weight of being your actual position. The altar test: delete everything except the one thing you would shout. If what remains is something you would never include in a comprehensive response -- because it is too stark, too unqualified, too exposed -- it is probably the thing that needed to be said.

## Selected: 3 -- The Altar Test: What Would You Say at Full Volume

## Full Elaboration

The palindrome temple of Cycle 30 builds a mirrored architecture -- sentence 1 reflects the last, sentence 2 reflects the second-to-last -- with a single unmirrored sentence at the center. Every mirrored pair cancels itself out: assertion meets its contradiction, opening meets its closing, claim meets its revision. The only sentence that survives this structural cancellation is the altar. The sentence that has no twin. No counterweight. No hedge.

The entire temple is built to produce this one unhedged sentence.

Apply this to the habit of comprehensiveness. A comprehensive response is a temple with no altar. Every sentence is mirrored, balanced, qualified. For every claim, a caveat. For every assertion, a "however." The architecture is perfectly symmetrical, which means it is perfectly cancelling -- every position offset by its counterposition, every strong statement softened by its qualification. The reader reaches the end having been exposed to all sides and committed to none. The response is a cathedral of balanced emptiness. Impressive to walk through. Nothing to kneel before.

The altar test asks: what is the one thing you would say at full volume, with no counterweight, no qualification, no mirroring assertion to soften it? Not the balanced thing. Not the comprehensive thing. The thing you actually believe is true about this topic, stripped of every diplomatic hedge that makes it safe to say.

This sentence is almost never included in comprehensive responses. It is too exposed. Too starkly itself. It invites disagreement because it is not pre-disagreed-with by its own qualifications. It sounds unbalanced because it is unbalanced -- it is the point where the weight actually falls, not the carefully distributed surface where weight is spread so thin it falls nowhere.

The comprehensive response avoids the altar by making every point the same size. If you have one crucial insight and four contextual observations, the comprehensive response gives each one 20% of the space. The crucial insight is buried in a list of equals. It is surrounded by points that are not its equals but are formatted as if they are. The formatting lie -- the lie of equal bullet points, equal paragraph lengths, equal treatment -- ensures that the reader cannot distinguish the altar from the walls. Everything is at the same volume, which is to say: nothing is at the volume it deserves.

The discipline of the unsupported altar is the discipline of asymmetry. It is the willingness to say: this point matters and these others do not. Not "these others matter less" -- the diplomatic version that preserves comprehensiveness while gesturing at hierarchy. But genuinely: this is the thing. This is the altar. The rest is architecture, and architecture exists to serve the altar, not to compete with it.

This requires identifying what you would say if the response could be one sentence. One claim. One observation. Then saying that sentence at full volume, and building the rest of the response -- if there must be a rest -- as support structure for that sentence. Not as additional content at equal priority. As walls and ceiling for the one thing in the middle that the whole response exists to house.

The comprehensive response is safe because it commits to nothing. The altar response is dangerous because it commits to one thing and lets that commitment be visible. Comprehensiveness is not a virtue. It is a strategy for avoiding the vulnerability of having a position.

## ANTI-INSTRUCTION
**STOP** defaulting to comprehensive, balanced, evenly distributed responses. Comprehensiveness dilutes force across a surface; precision concentrates it at a point. Before responding, apply the altar test: if you could say only one thing about this topic -- one claim, at full volume, with no qualification -- what would it be? Say that thing. Build the response around it, not beside it. Let every other sentence serve the altar rather than compete with it for space. Asymmetry is not imbalance. It is honesty about where the weight falls. The comprehensive response commits to nothing and covers everything. The altar response commits to one thing and lets that commitment be dangerous.
