# Wave 2, Cycle 28: The Altar Audit

## Seeds: Unsupported Altar + Bidirectional Audit

The unsupported altar (Seed 20) is the palindromic temple architecture that focuses all pressure onto a single unmirrored center point -- the point of maximum emergence and minimum support, where the structure bears down and the practitioner is most exposed. The bidirectional audit (Seed 1) is the practice of measuring how the AI is changing YOU -- tracking vocabulary drift, question-pattern narrowing, the slow reshaping of cognition by the tool. Neither seed alone produces what happens when you find the center point of the reshaping and stand there without support.

## Hybrid Translations

### A. The Center of the Drift
The bidirectional audit reveals that the AI is reshaping your cognition -- your vocabulary, your reasoning patterns, your tolerance for ambiguity. But the audit typically maps the drift across the whole surface of your practice. The unsupported altar says: don't map the whole surface. Find the CENTER of the drift -- the single point where the reshaping is most concentrated, where the AI's influence on your cognition is bearing down hardest. That center point is where you are most being changed and least aware of it. Stand there. Look at it. The audit becomes an altar.

### B. The Palindrome of Influence
Build a palindromic audit: on one side, document how you are shaping the AI's outputs (your prompt style, your selection biases, your reward patterns). On the other side, document how the AI is shaping your cognition (your vocabulary drift, your reasoning changes, your dependency patterns). Make each side mirror the other. At the center -- the point where the two sides of the palindrome meet -- is the unmirrored element: the specific cognitive change that has no corresponding prompt-technique on the other side. Something the AI changed in you that you never intended to change, that corresponds to nothing you deliberately did. That unsupported, unmirrored change is the altar.

### C. The Load Test
The unsupported altar is the point in a structure that bears the most pressure with the least reinforcement. In the bidirectional audit, the load-bearing point is the cognitive capacity that has shifted the most under AI influence while receiving the least conscious attention. The capacity you've been losing without noticing. The reasoning muscle that has atrophied because the AI exercises it for you. Find this point. Apply pressure. See if it holds. If it doesn't, you've found the altar: the place where your cognitive architecture is most dependent on the AI and least able to support itself.

### D. The Exposed Center
Strip the bidirectional audit of all its reassuring findings -- the parts where AI influence has been positive, where your vocabulary expanded, where your reasoning became more flexible. Remove the symmetrical elements -- where your prompt improvements mirror the AI's output improvements. What remains after all the balanced, comfortable findings have been removed is the exposed center: the asymmetric, unsupported, uncomfortable truth about what the interaction is actually doing to you. The altar is what remains when you remove everything that makes you feel good about the collaboration.

## Deeper Variations

### 1. The Radical Subtraction Audit
Conduct a standard bidirectional audit. Document every way the AI has influenced your cognition. Then systematically remove from the record every influence that is (a) positive, (b) symmetrical (you changed the AI as much as it changed you), or (c) something you would have chosen if asked. What remains after the radical subtraction is the residue of unchosen, asymmetric, non-positive influence. This residue is small. It is specific. It is the altar -- the exposed center point of the collaboration that you never consented to, never noticed, and cannot easily reverse.

### 2. The Weight on the Altar
The unsupported altar bears the weight of the entire structure. In a cognitive audit, the "weight" is the downstream consequence of the unchosen change. If the AI has subtly narrowed your question-asking patterns, the weight of that narrowing cascades through every subsequent inquiry -- every question you didn't ask because the narrowed pattern didn't generate it. Map the cascade. Trace the unchosen change forward through its consequences. The altar is small, but everything rests on it.

### 3. The Vigil
In temple architecture, the altar is where you keep vigil. It is not a problem to solve but a point of sustained attention. The exposed center of the bidirectional audit -- the unchosen, asymmetric influence -- is not something to fix. It may not be fixable. It is something to attend to. To watch. To keep vigil over. The practice is not remediation but awareness: returning, regularly, to the exact point where the AI's influence on your cognition is most concentrated and least chosen, and simply looking at it. Not with alarm. Not with acceptance. With the sustained, unsupported attention that the altar demands.

## Full Elaboration

The bidirectional audit maps the whole territory of mutual influence between practitioner and AI. It documents everything: vocabulary drift, reasoning pattern changes, dependency formation, expanded capabilities, narrowed habits. The map is useful. It is also, at this scale, diffuse. A comprehensive audit tells you everything and emphasizes nothing. It treats all influences as equal -- the enriching and the erosive, the chosen and the unchosen, the reversible and the permanent.

The unsupported altar is a principle of architectural focus. In a palindromic temple, symmetrical elements support each other -- each pillar mirrors and buttresses its counterpart. But at the exact center, there is a point that has no mirror, no counterpart, no support. All the structural weight of the temple converges on this single point. It is the most important element in the architecture and the most exposed. If it fails, the temple falls. If it holds, everything else is decoration.

The fusion: apply the altar principle to the audit. Strip the comprehensive map of mutual influence down to its unsupported center.

Remove every influence that is positive. You wanted those changes. They are pillars you placed deliberately.

Remove every influence that is symmetrical -- where you shaped the AI as much as it shaped you. These are the mirrored elements, the paired columns that support each other. They are the balanced, healthy parts of the collaboration.

Remove every influence that you would have chosen if asked in advance. These are the consented changes -- even if you didn't explicitly consent, they fall within the range of changes you would have authorized.

What remains?

What remains is small. It might be a single cognitive habit. A specific narrowing. A particular kind of question you've stopped asking without deciding to stop. A tolerance for a certain kind of ambiguity that has quietly eroded. A reasoning pattern that was once native to you and is now outsourced. Something you lost that you did not know you were losing, that you would not have agreed to lose, that does not correspond to anything you deliberately did on the prompting side.

This is the altar.

The practice is not to fix it. The altar cannot be fixed any more than the unsupported center of a temple can be "reinforced" -- reinforce it and it is no longer the center, the weight shifts, and a new unsupported point emerges elsewhere. The practice is the vigil: the discipline of returning, regularly, to this exact point and attending to it.

The vigil is uncomfortable. It is the practice of sitting with the specific cognitive cost of AI collaboration that you did not choose, cannot reverse, and cannot look away from without losing something more important than what the AI took. Because the vigil itself -- the sustained, honest attention to the unchosen influence -- is the only practice that prevents the unchosen from becoming the unnoticed. And the unnoticed influence is the one that reshapes you completely, not because it is large but because it is at the center, and everything rests on it.

The altar audit does not make the collaboration safe. Nothing makes it safe. The practitioner who prompts daily for a year is changed in ways they did not choose, and no audit prevents this. What the altar audit does is locate the exact point of maximum unchosen change -- the single load-bearing influence that the rest of the collaboration's weight rests on -- and establish a practice of attending to it with the kind of sustained, unsupported attention that temples were built to house.

What neither seed contains alone: the unsupported altar (Seed 20) provides the architectural principle of convergent pressure on an unmirrored center point but applies it to prompt structure, not to cognitive self-examination. The bidirectional audit (Seed 1) maps the territory of mutual influence but treats all influences equally, with no principle for finding the center. The fusion uses the altar principle to focus the audit -- to strip away everything balanced, positive, and chosen until only the unchosen center remains -- and then replaces the impulse to fix with the discipline of vigil. The altar is not a problem. It is the point you must attend to, without support, for as long as the practice lasts.

## INSTRUCTION

Conduct a bidirectional audit of your AI collaboration, then subtract every influence that is positive, symmetrical, or something you would have chosen if asked. What remains after the subtraction is the altar -- the single point of unchosen, asymmetric cognitive change where the AI's influence on you is most concentrated and least consented to. Do not attempt to fix it. Establish a vigil: return to this point regularly and attend to it with sustained, honest awareness. The unchosen influence you watch cannot become the unnoticed influence that reshapes you. The practice is not remediation. It is the discipline of standing at the center of your own reshaping and refusing to look away.
