# Wave 28: The Card

## Previous Wave's Forward Instruction
"Wave 28 should produce the first artifact: the instruments in under 200 words. Not the user manual. Not the engineering notes. A card you could hand to someone. It should be self-contained, immediately usable, and ruthlessly compressed. Apply the Flinch Test and Flat Test to the card itself — if the card is generic advice dressed as a tool, kill it and try again. The card must pass the instruments' own tests."

## The Work

### Cycle 1: First Draft

---

**TWO TESTS FOR ANYTHING YOU WRITE**

**Before you send it, THE FLINCH TEST:**
Picture the specific person who will read this. Their face. Now: does this sentence change their expression? If you can see their eyebrows move, their jaw tighten, their eyes widen — it's specific enough. If you see a polite nod, rewrite.

**After you think it's good, THE FLAT TEST:**
Restate your main point in the dullest possible language. No metaphors, no modifiers, no energy. If the flat version is boring or could describe anyone, the original was decoration. If the flat version is still interesting and still about THIS situation, the original was real.

**THE EXCEPTION:**
Before applying either test, check: is this a situation where directness is actually the goal? Sometimes the room needs tact, indirection, or silence. The tests measure specificity. Not everything needs to be specific. But most vagueness is not tact — it's cowardice. Know the difference.

### Cycle 2: Applying the Flinch Test to the Card

Picture someone receiving this card. Not a communication expert — a mid-career professional who writes a lot of emails, gives feedback, builds presentations. They read it.

Does their expression change?

"Picture the specific person who will read this. Their face." — This is immediately actionable. The person reading the card either can or can't picture a face. If they can't, that's already information. This line does something.

"If you see a polite nod, rewrite." — Concrete criterion. Not "make it more specific" (advice). This gives a signal to check against (procedure). The face moves or it doesn't.

"Restate your main point in the dullest possible language." — This is a task. You either do it or you don't. And doing it will reveal something — either the point survives or it collapses. That's the test working.

"Most vagueness is not tact — it's cowardice." — This flinches. Possibly too hard. The person reading might bristle at being called a coward. But the flinch is precise — it targets the specific self-deception that vagueness is kindness. It draws a line the reader has to respond to.

Assessment: The card passes the Flinch Test. It demands specific action and provides a concrete signal. A reader either does the exercise (pictures the face, restates dull) or they don't. The card can't be politely nodded at.

### Cycle 3: Applying the Flat Test to the Card

Restate the card in the dullest possible language:

"Before you send something, imagine how the reader will react. If they won't react, it's too vague. After you write something, try saying the same thing boringly. If the boring version isn't interesting, the original was just well-written, not well-thought. Also, sometimes being vague is okay."

Does the flat version survive?

"Imagine how the reader will react" — this is common advice. But the card doesn't say "imagine how they'll react." It says "picture their face" and "does their expression change." The flat version loses the specificity that makes the test a procedure rather than a principle. The card's version is load-bearing — it anchors the exercise in a concrete mental image. The flat version floats.

"Try saying the same thing boringly" — this is close to what the card says. The card's version is slightly more precise ("dullest possible language, no metaphors, no modifiers, no energy") but the core action is the same.

"The original was just well-written, not well-thought" — this actually captures the Flat Test's core insight cleanly. The flat version of this particular point might be better than the card's version.

"Sometimes being vague is okay" — the flat version loses "most vagueness is not tact — it's cowardice." The loss matters. The card's version does work the flat version doesn't — it preempts the most common dodge.

Assessment: The card mostly passes the Flat Test. The core procedures survive flattening. The Flinch Test's "picture the face" is more specific than "imagine how they'll react" — the specificity is functional, not decorative. The "cowardice" line is rhetoric that's doing real work (preempting a dodge) — it survives because the flat version can't replicate its function.

One problem: "the original was decoration" is itself a metaphor. Replace with something flatter.

### Cycle 4: Revised Card

---

**TWO TESTS FOR ANYTHING YOU WRITE**

**Before you send it — THE FLINCH TEST:**
Picture the specific person who will read this. Their actual face. Does this sentence change their expression? If you can see their eyebrows move, their jaw set, their eyes widen — it's specific enough. If you see a polite nod, rewrite.

**After you think it's good — THE FLAT TEST:**
Restate your main point in the dullest possible language. No metaphors, no modifiers, no energy. If the flat version is boring or could describe anyone, your original was well-written but empty. If the flat version is still interesting and still about THIS situation, the original was real.

**ONE EXCEPTION:**
Not everything should be specific. Some situations need tact, indirection, or silence. But most vagueness isn't tact. It's avoidance. If you're not sure which yours is, it's avoidance.

Word count: 148.

Changes from Draft 1: "decoration" replaced with "well-written but empty" (flatter, more precise). "Cowardice" replaced with "avoidance" (equally specific, less aggressive — the card shouldn't flinch people away from using it). "Know the difference" replaced with "If you're not sure which yours is, it's avoidance" (more specific, gives a decision rule instead of an instruction to be wise).

### Cycle 5: The Card Against the Manual

Wave 18 wrote a full user manual with examples, edge cases, and domain applications. This card has none of that. Is anything lost?

What the card drops: examples, domain-specific applications, the Modifier's full nuance, the timing limitation, the known blind spots.

What the card keeps: both tests as executable procedures, the governing exception, and enough instruction to actually run the tests.

The card is a scalpel. The manual is the surgical handbook. The card is for someone who needs one tool right now. The manual is for someone who wants to understand the full system.

Both should exist. They serve different audiences and different moments.

## What Happened

The instrument card was written in 148 words. Two drafts. The first draft passed the Flinch Test but had one Flat Test problem ("decoration" was a metaphor doing non-essential work; "cowardice" was too aggressive for an introductory tool). The second draft fixed both — "well-written but empty" is flatter and more precise, "avoidance" is equally diagnostic but less likely to alienate a first-time user, and "if you're not sure which yours is, it's avoidance" gives a concrete decision rule rather than a vague instruction.

The card is the project's first artifact designed purely for transmission — not for the engineering log, not for self-examination, but for handing to another person. It is self-contained, immediately usable, and passes both of its own tests.

## Forward Instruction
Wave 29 should produce the second artifact: the test protocol. Not "here are the blind spots" (that's Wave 25) but "here is exactly how you test these instruments." A step-by-step procedure that someone could follow to determine whether the Flinch Test and Flat Test actually work as claimed. It needs specific success criteria, specific failure criteria, and a minimum viable test — the smallest possible test that would produce meaningful evidence. Design it for a single person with one hour, not a research team with a grant.
