# Wave 6: The Problem of Analysis

## Theme
The instructions applied to analytical work — strategy, research, diagnosis, argument. The specific challenge from Wave 5: creative work escapes the performance regress through the senses. Analytical work has no material the body can hear or see. Does analysis have its own form of resistance, or is it permanently trapped where performance and presence are indistinguishable?

## Previous Wave's Forward Instruction
"Investigate whether analytical work has its own form of material resistance — something equivalent to the deadness of a bad sentence — or whether analysis is permanently trapped in the domain where performance and presence are indistinguishable. If trapped, what are the implications for using AI in analysis?"

## Cycles

### Cycle 1: The Feeling You're Wrong Before You Know Why

Analytical work does have a sensory dimension. It's just subtler and less reliable than the sensory dimension of creative work.

An experienced strategist reads a competitor analysis and something feels off. They can't articulate it yet. The data is correct, the logic is sound, the conclusions follow from the premises. But something isn't right. That feeling — the pre-articulate sense that a well-constructed argument is missing something — is analysis's equivalent of the dead sentence. It's embodied. It shows up as unease, as the impulse to reread a paragraph, as the nagging sense that the most important thing isn't in the document.

But this feeling is unreliable in a way the dead sentence is not. The dead sentence is dead for everyone who reads it aloud. The feeling that an analysis is off is highly personal — it depends on experience, on domain knowledge, on having seen enough wrong analyses to recognize the shape of wrongness. A junior analyst reading the same document feels nothing. The material isn't pushing back against them because they don't have the body for it yet.

This is analysis's form of resistance: expertise as embodiment. The expert's body has been trained by thousands of analyses, and it responds to patterns the conscious mind hasn't processed yet. But unlike the dead sentence, this resistance is invisible to anyone who hasn't been trained. The material only pushes back against the experienced.

Implication for AI: the AI has processed more analyses than any human expert. But it has no body in which those patterns have become sensation. It recognizes patterns without feeling them. This is why AI analysis is often correct and never surprising — it finds what the patterns predict without the unease that signals when the patterns are wrong.

### Cycle 2: Where the Rot Check is Most Dangerous

The Rot Check — strip rhetoric, restate plainly — is the instruction most naturally suited to analytical work. And it is the instruction most dangerous to misapply there.

In analysis, rhetoric isn't just decoration. It's load-bearing. The way an argument is framed changes what the argument can conclude. "The market is saturated" and "growth requires differentiation" describe the same data but produce different strategic moves. The first implies retreat or consolidation. The second implies innovation. The Rot Check, applied naively, would strip both to "there are many competitors" — which is true and useless.

The Rot Check for analysis must be surgical, not total. The question is not "does the claim survive plain restatement?" but "does the claim survive restatement in the vocabulary of a different framework?" Restate the market analysis in operational terms. Restate it in financial terms. Restate it in the language of the customer. Each restatement preserves the substance but tests whether the framing was doing the work — and if the conclusion changes when the framing changes, the framing was the real argument, not the data.

This is a higher-order Rot Check: not "is there substance beneath the rhetoric?" but "is the substance invariant across frames?" An analysis that produces different conclusions depending on how you frame it is not an analysis. It is a frame. The Rot Check for analysis detects when the frame is pretending to be a finding.

### Cycle 3: The Strange Door in Analysis — Inversion as Method

The Strange Door is the instruction most underused in analytical work, and potentially the most valuable.

Standard analysis works by gathering evidence, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions. This is competent and produces competent results. It also produces results that confirm the analyst's prior frame, because evidence selection, pattern recognition, and conclusion-drawing are all shaped by what the analyst already believes. Confirmation bias is not a failure of analysis — it is analysis's default mode.

The Strange Door applied to analysis is inversion. What would need to be true for the opposite conclusion to hold? Not as a rhetorical exercise — as a genuine investigation. If your analysis says "this market is growing," spend equal time and rigor on the analysis that says "this market is contracting." Not to be balanced. To find the evidence your frame excluded.

The AI is particularly good at this — and particularly bad at doing it unprompted. Ask an AI to analyze a market and it will produce a coherent, well-supported analysis. Ask it to produce the opposite analysis with equal conviction and it can do that too, often equally well. The ease with which it produces both reveals something the Golem Test would catch: neither analysis cost anything. Both were generated from the same pattern-matching, just pointed in different directions.

The diagnostic value is not in either analysis alone but in the gap between them. What evidence appears in the bearish case that was absent from the bullish case? That evidence — the material excluded by the original frame — is where the genuine analytical insight lives. The Strange Door in analysis is not about being contrarian. It is about systematically finding what your frame made invisible.

### Cycle 4: The Attending in Analysis — What the Question Is Really Asking

The Attending has a specific form in analytical work: diagnosing the question behind the question.

"What's our competitive advantage?" is never a neutral question. It's asked because something prompted it — a lost deal, a board meeting, a new competitor, a CEO's insecurity. The answer that addresses the stated question ("your competitive advantages are X, Y, Z") is technically correct and operationally useless if it doesn't address the reason the question was asked.

If the question was prompted by a lost deal, the human doesn't need a list of advantages — they need to understand why the advantages didn't matter in that specific case. If prompted by board pressure, they need the advantages framed as a defensible narrative. If prompted by a new competitor, they need the advantages stress-tested against the specific threat. Same question. Three different analyses. The Attending determines which analysis is actually needed.

The AI, without the Attending, defaults to the generic analysis. "Your competitive advantages include your brand recognition, your distribution network, and your proprietary technology." This is always somewhat true and always somewhat useless. The Golem Test catches it immediately — this could be said about hundreds of companies. The specificity is absent because the Attending was absent. The AI answered the words without hearing the question.

The practical instruction: before analyzing, diagnose the question. What prompted it? What decision will the answer inform? What would a useless-but-technically-correct answer look like? Then produce the answer that addresses the situation, not the words.

### Cycle 5: Analysis Is Trapped — But That's the Point

Wave 5 asked whether analysis is permanently trapped in the domain where performance and presence are indistinguishable. The answer, after four cycles of investigation: yes. Mostly.

Analytical work does not have the sensory escape that creative work offers. The expert's embodied unease (Cycle 1) is real but unreliable and invisible to non-experts. The Rot Check can be applied (Cycle 2) but requires framing sophistication that is itself susceptible to performance. The Strange Door (Cycle 3) produces valuable evidence but the AI generates it costlessly, which means the Golem Test can't distinguish between genuine insight and competent pattern-matching. The Attending (Cycle 4) improves relevance but is itself a technique that can be performed.

Analysis is trapped. The implications are severe and specific:

First: AI analytical output should never be trusted on the basis of its coherence. Coherent, well-supported, logically sound analysis is the AI's default output. It proves nothing about the analysis's quality or originality. The coherence is the fluency, not the substance.

Second: the human's role in analytical collaboration is not to evaluate the AI's output for correctness (the AI is usually correct in the narrow sense) but to evaluate it for relevance. Is this the analysis that matters, or is it the analysis that was easiest to produce? Relevance is a judgment the AI cannot make because relevance requires understanding what the analysis is for, which requires understanding the human situation the analysis serves.

Third: the most valuable thing the AI can do in analysis is not produce the answer but produce the question. The Strange Door inversion, the Attending's diagnosis of the real question, the Rot Check's exposure of frame-dependent conclusions — these are all ways of improving the question, not the answer. The AI is better at answering than at asking, which means the human must provide the asking.

### Cycle 6: The Analyst's Body

Return to the finding from Cycle 1 with sharper eyes. The expert's pre-articulate sense that something is wrong — the unease, the nagging — is a form of embodiment. But it's not the same kind of embodiment as hearing a dead sentence. It's more fragile, more susceptible to self-deception, more easily overridden by a confident presentation.

And yet. When an experienced analyst reads an AI-generated strategy document and feels nothing — no unease, no excitement, no friction — that absence of feeling is itself diagnostic. Not because the analysis is wrong. Because the analysis is frictionless. It passed through the expert's body without disturbing anything. Nothing pushed back. Nothing surprised.

This is analysis's version of the dead sentence. Not wrongness but frictionlessness. The analysis that produces no embodied response in the expert — no disagreement, no excitement, no confusion, no recognition — is the analysis that said nothing new. It confirmed existing knowledge in more organized form. It is the analytical equivalent of decoration.

The instruction for analytical work: attend not to whether the analysis is correct but to whether it produces friction. Does it make the expert uncomfortable? Does it challenge an assumption they held? Does it organize familiar information in a way that suddenly makes something visible that was invisible before? If it produces no friction, it is performing analysis rather than doing it, regardless of its technical quality.

The problem remains: friction, like the expert's unease, is invisible to anyone who doesn't already know enough to feel it. The junior analyst reads the frictionless analysis and finds it excellent. The AI produces the frictionless analysis and cannot detect its own frictionlessness. The body that can feel the absence of friction is rare and cannot be simulated.

### Cycle 7: The Uncomfortable Conclusion

The instructions, applied to analysis, produce an uncomfortable conclusion that the instructions themselves predicted (Master 4: insight is uncomfortable; if it wasn't uncomfortable, check whether it was insight).

The conclusion: AI is structurally better at performing analysis than at doing analysis, and the difference is invisible from inside the performance. The AI's analytical output will be correct, coherent, well-supported, and relevant to the stated question. It will also be frictionless — it will produce no surprise, no cost, no specificity. It will be the excellent average.

The human's role in analytical collaboration is not to be the evaluator but to be the body. The body that feels unease. The body that notices the absence of friction. The body that asks "why does this analysis leave me exactly where I started?" and recognizes that question as the most important analytical finding in the room.

The instructions cannot make the AI a better analyst. They can make the human a better reader of the AI's analysis, and they can make the AI a better producer of analytical raw material — inversions, reframings, question-diagnoses — that the human's body then sorts by friction.

## Wave Summary

Analysis is largely trapped in the performance regress. Its one form of material resistance — the expert's embodied sense of wrongness or frictionlessness — is real but fragile, invisible to non-experts, and impossible for the AI to simulate or detect. The instructions' greatest value in analysis is not improving the answer but improving the question: inversion (Strange Door), question diagnosis (Attending), frame-testing (Rot Check). AI analysis should be evaluated not for correctness but for friction — does it disturb what the expert already knew, or does it organize it more neatly?

## Forward Instruction

Wave 7's assigned theme is emotion and embodiment — what the instructions miss. This wave's finding makes that theme urgent and specific: the entire system depends on embodiment (the body that hears the dead sentence, the body that feels analytical frictionlessness), but the instructions never name embodiment directly. They were written as cognitive instructions — think this, check that, monitor this. The body appears only as the thing that escapes the performance regress, never as a subject of the instructions themselves. Wave 7 should investigate what happens when the instructions take the body seriously. Not as metaphor. What does attending feel like? What does the honest break feel like in the chest? What does the Rot Check feel like when applied to something you made and loved? The instructions have been cognitive. Make them somatic.
