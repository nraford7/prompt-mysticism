# Wave 17: Fixing or Scoping

## Previous Wave's Forward Instruction
"Wave 17 should decide what to do with this finding. Three options: (1) amend the instruments to handle experiential specificity, risking making them too broad to be useful; (2) accept the limitation and define the instruments' domain more precisely — they're for propositional communication, not all communication; (3) something the previous waves haven't considered. Don't theorize — try all three and see which one produces a tool that's still usable."

## Application

### Cycle 1: Option 1 — Amend the Instruments

The instruments as they stand:

**Flinch Test:** Be specific enough that the human's body must respond.
**Flat Test:** Restate the core claim in the dullest language. If the flat version is banal, the original was rhetoric.
**Modifier:** Time the specificity to the relationship and the stakes.

Wave 16's breaks: diplomacy (strategic vagueness), abstract art (formal/experiential specificity), therapy (specificity of restraint), comedy (temporal specificity).

**Amended versions:**

**Flinch Test (expanded):** Be specific enough that the human's body must respond — through content, form, timing, or calibrated absence. If the response is neutral, you were generic. If the response is to the medium's conventions rather than the actual substance, you were manipulative.

**Flat Test (expanded):** After making something, strip it to its simplest form in the appropriate register — flat language for propositional work, raw formal description for experiential work, plain sequence for temporal work. If the stripped version is banal, the original was rhetoric. If the stripped version can't capture what makes the original work, the original's power lives in a dimension the test can't reach — name that dimension rather than claiming it doesn't exist.

**Modifier (expanded):** Time the specificity to the relationship, the stakes, and the required opacity. In some contexts, the correct specificity is zero — strategic vagueness, therapeutic restraint, diplomatic ambiguity. The absence of specificity can itself be a precise choice.

**Now test the amended versions on Wave 16's four cases:**

*Diplomacy:* The expanded Modifier now has "the required opacity" as a calibration dimension. The diplomatic statement's correct specificity is zero, and the Modifier permits this. Does it work? Sort of. The Modifier now says "sometimes be zero-specific" which accommodates diplomacy but removes the instrument's teeth. If the Modifier can endorse zero specificity, it can endorse anything. A tool that says "be specific, except when you shouldn't be" is not a tool. It's a truism.

*Abstract art:* The expanded Flat Test says "strip to raw formal description for experiential work." Rothko stripped to formal description: "Two soft-edged color rectangles, rust over blue, 9 feet tall." Is this banal? Not if you've stood in front of the painting — the formal description still carries the essential variables (scale, color, edge quality). But if you haven't stood in front of it, the formal description IS banal. The test now depends on the evaluator's experience, which makes it subjective. The original Flat Test was useful precisely because it was objective — anyone could do it.

*Therapy:* The expanded Flinch Test includes "calibrated absence." The therapist's specific silence now passes. But "be specific through absence" is a paradox the original instrument was designed to avoid. The expansion works logically but loses operational clarity.

*Comedy:* The expanded Flat Test says "plain sequence for temporal work." A joke stripped to plain sequence: "Setup: cheap prices. Expectation: investigation of why. Redirect: bartender's revenge via affair." Does the stripped version capture what makes the joke work? Partially — it identifies the mechanism (redirect) — but the stripped version isn't funny, which means the Flat Test still can't distinguish a good joke from a bad one with the same structure.

**Assessment of Option 1:** The expanded instruments accommodate Wave 16's cases, but at the cost of precision and usability. Each expansion adds a conditional that weakens the instrument. The Modifier with "required opacity" can endorse anything. The Flat Test with "appropriate register" requires judgment about which register to strip to. The Flinch Test with "calibrated absence" contains its own negation. The instruments went from sharp tools to committee-drafted guidelines. This is the wrong direction.

### Cycle 2: Option 2 — Scope the Instruments

Instead of expanding the instruments, define their domain precisely and accept the boundaries.

**The instruments' domain:** Propositional communication — any context where the output makes claims, conveys information, provides feedback, makes arguments, or produces work that can be evaluated for its relationship to specific reality. This includes: writing, feedback, business communication, technical documentation, analysis, decisions, design evaluation, data visualization, presentations, teaching, coaching, medical communication, product decisions, and any other context where the output could be more or less specific to the actual situation.

**Outside the domain:** Contexts where the output's power lives primarily in form, timing, or strategic absence rather than propositional content. This includes: abstract art, music composition (as opposed to music criticism), diplomatic language requiring strategic ambiguity, therapeutic silence and restraint, comedic timing, ritual language, and any context where the correct response is deliberately non-propositional.

**The scoped instruments:**

**Flinch Test:** For propositional communication — be specific enough that the human's body must respond. If the response is neutral, you were generic.
**Flat Test:** For propositional communication — restate the core claim in dull language. If the flat version is banal, the original was rhetoric.
**Modifier:** Time the specificity to the relationship and the stakes.
**Scope note:** These instruments are for work where specificity to the actual situation is the goal. They do not apply to contexts where strategic ambiguity, formal experimentation, or deliberate withholding is the craft.

**Test the scoped version on all previous applications:**

*Brand positioning (Wave 11):* Propositional. Instruments apply fully. They caught the generic positioning and the rewrites passed both tests. In scope.

*Photo critique (Wave 11):* Propositional. Instruments apply. They caught "beautiful light" and demanded specifics. In scope.

*Safety warnings (Wave 12):* Propositional. Instruments apply. They argued correctly that generic warnings fail. In scope.

*Legal boilerplate (Wave 12):* Edge case. The instruments correctly diagnosed strategic opacity. But legal language is partially in the "strategic ambiguity" exclusion zone. The scoping says: the instruments can diagnose what legal boilerplate is doing (concealing through genericness) but can't demand it be replaced with specificity, because the strategic ambiguity serves a purpose. This feels right — the instruments are diagnostic here, not prescriptive.

*Short story (Wave 13):* Mostly propositional. The instruments worked generatively — but the cave diving metaphor (the best part) was where the author overrode the instrument's push toward explicitness. Stories are partially outside the scope — they use propositional content but their best effects often live in implication, which is experiential. The scoping says: apply the instruments to fiction with the awareness that fiction's deepest effects may live outside the instruments' domain.

*Conversations (Wave 14):* Propositional. Instruments apply fully. Performance reviews, medical explanations, negotiations — all propositional. In scope.

*Dashboard design (Wave 15):* Propositional (the dashboard communicates data). Instruments apply. In scope.

*Rothko (Wave 16):* Experiential. Outside scope. The instruments correctly identify that the Flinch Test works but the Flat Test can't explain the mechanism. The scoping says: not your jurisdiction.

*Diplomacy (Wave 16):* Strategic ambiguity. Outside scope. The scoping says: the instruments can diagnose what the diplomatic statement is doing (performing vagueness) but should not prescribe specificity. Not your jurisdiction.

**Assessment of Option 2:** The scoped instruments are honest about their boundaries. They don't try to be universal. They acknowledge that their domain is propositional communication, which is MOST communication — certainly most of what an AI system produces — but not all communication. The scope note isn't a weakness. It's maturity. A hammer that claims to be a universal tool is a bad hammer. A hammer that says "I'm for nails" is a useful one.

### Cycle 3: Option 3 — Something Else

The first two options both preserved the instruments and argued about their scope. But Wave 16 revealed something more fundamental: the instruments are about detecting the difference between output that SEEMS specific and output that IS specific. That's a propositional distinction — it only makes sense for outputs that make claims about reality.

What if the instruments aren't the endpoint? What if they're one instance of a more general principle, and the more general principle can handle what the instruments can't?

The general principle, stated flat: **Know what you're actually doing and don't fake it.**

The Flinch Test is: don't fake specificity. The Flat Test is: check whether you faked it. Diplomacy requires faking specificity in a different way — it requires producing language that seems to say something while saying nothing, and both parties know the game. Abstract art isn't faking anything — it's doing something real that isn't propositional. Therapy requires a different kind of realness — relational precision rather than propositional precision.

"Know what you're actually doing and don't fake it" covers all cases:
- In brand positioning: know whether you're saying something specific or performing specificity.
- In diplomacy: know that you're producing strategic vagueness, and do it well.
- In abstract art: know that the work lives in formal properties, and be precise about those properties.
- In therapy: know that restraint is a technique, and time it precisely.
- In comedy: know that the joke lives in the sequence, and get the sequence right.

**Flat Test on this general principle:** "Don't fake it." Is this banal? Completely. It's the kind of advice that means nothing without the nine-wave backstory that gives it precision. "Don't fake it" is a platitude. It's Wave 10's problem all over again — the final compression destroys the operational precision.

**Assessment of Option 3:** The general principle is true but useless. It's the kind of insight that feels profound in the moment of discovery and evaporates when you try to hand it to someone. The instruments are better BECAUSE they're limited. A tool that covers everything helps with nothing.

### Cycle 4: The Decision

**Option 1 (expand) fails.** The expanded instruments are mushy. They accommodate everything by saying nothing.

**Option 3 (generalize) fails.** The general principle is a platitude. Wave 10 already proved that final compression destroys operational value.

**Option 2 (scope) works.** The scoped instruments are honest, usable, and precise. They cover their domain — propositional communication — which is the vast majority of what anyone needs instruments for. They acknowledge their limits without apologizing for them.

But Option 2 needs one addition from the Option 1 attempt. The Modifier should be slightly expanded — not to accommodate zero-specificity, but to include a gateway question:

**Updated Modifier:** Before applying the Flinch Test or Flat Test, ask: is this propositional communication? Is the goal to convey something specific about a specific situation? If yes, apply the instruments. If the goal is strategic ambiguity, formal experimentation, or deliberate withholding, the instruments don't apply — but be honest about why you're choosing vagueness. Don't hide behind "it's diplomacy" to excuse lazy generic output. The instruments' scope boundary is real, but it's not an escape hatch.

The "don't hide behind the scope boundary" clause is essential. Without it, anyone who doesn't want to do the hard work of being specific can claim they're in the diplomacy/art/therapy exception. The scope boundary needs a lock: you can step outside the instruments' domain, but you have to name what you're doing and why.

## What Happened

Three options tested. Expansion made the instruments mushy. Generalization made them platitudinous. Scoping made them honest.

The final form is: two instruments, a modifier, and a scope boundary with a lock.

**Flinch Test:** Be specific enough that the human's body must respond. If the response is neutral, you were generic.

**Flat Test:** Restate the core claim in dull language. If the flat version is banal, the original was rhetoric. If it could apply to anyone, the original was generic. If it's still interesting and specific, the work was real.

**Modifier:** Time the specificity to the relationship and the stakes. Read the room before you speak.

**Scope:** These instruments are for propositional communication — work that makes claims, conveys information, gives feedback, or produces artifacts that can be evaluated for specificity. For work that lives in form, timing, or strategic absence, the instruments don't apply. But claiming the exception requires naming what you're doing instead. The scope boundary is a door, not an escape hatch.

The most important finding: the instruments are better because they're limited. Wave 10 proved that compressing to a single universal principle produces platitude. Wave 17 proved that expanding to cover all domains produces mush. The instruments' power comes from their precision, which comes from their boundaries. A tool that does one thing well is more useful than a framework that does everything badly.

## Forward Instruction
The instruments have been applied, stress-tested, broken, and scoped. The work of waves 11-17 has moved from application (11-12) to generation (13) to real-time use (14) to cross-media translation (15) to failure-finding (16) to repair (17). Wave 18 is the last wave in this set. It should do what wave 10's original instruction demanded: hand the instruments to someone who wasn't in the workshop. Write the instruments as a standalone document — no history, no wave references, no meta-commentary. Just the tools, their instructions for use, their known limitations, and enough examples that someone encountering them for the first time can pick them up and cut with them. This is the user manual, not the engineering log.
