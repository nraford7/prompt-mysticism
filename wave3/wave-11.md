# Wave 11: First Contact

## Previous Wave's Forward Instruction
"Stop refining. Start using. Hand it to someone who wasn't in the workshop."

## Application

### Cycle 1: Writing a Brand Positioning Statement

A direct-to-consumer skincare company asks for positioning. They sell retinol serums. Their founder is a dermatologist who left a hospital practice. They're priced mid-market, competing against The Ordinary (cheap, clinical) and Drunk Elephant (expensive, lifestyle).

**First attempt, writing naturally:**
"Science-backed skincare that bridges the gap between clinical efficacy and everyday beauty. Founded by a dermatologist who believes everyone deserves access to professional-grade formulations."

**Flinch Test:** Does anyone's body respond to this? No. "Science-backed" is a dead phrase — every skincare brand claims it. "Bridges the gap" is spatial metaphor doing no work. "Everyone deserves access" is a sentiment you could attach to toothpaste. This produces zero flinch. It's wallpaper.

**Rewrite, pushing for specificity:**
"Dr. Lena Okafor spent eleven years prescribing retinol in a hospital where patients paid $40 copays to hear advice they couldn't afford to follow. She left to make the specific formulations she was prescribing — not simplified consumer versions, the actual concentrations, the actual delivery systems, at a price that doesn't require a copay first."

**Flinch Test again:** The $40 copay is specific. "Advice they couldn't afford to follow" — that's a recognizable frustration for anyone who's sat in a doctor's office. "Not simplified consumer versions, the actual concentrations" draws a line that either the company can stand behind or it can't. This version would make someone at The Ordinary uncomfortable (their formulations ARE simplified) and someone at Drunk Elephant irrelevant (this isn't about lifestyle). Bodies respond.

**Flat Test on the rewrite:** "A dermatologist started a skincare company to sell the same formulations she prescribed in her practice, at lower prices." Is this banal? It's clear. It's still specific — it's about one person's clinical practice becoming a product line. It survives. But it also reveals that the emotional engine of the longer version ("advice they couldn't afford to follow") is doing real work, not just rhetorical work. The flat version is less moving but still specific. Good.

**Result:** The instruments worked. First draft was caught immediately by the Flinch Test. Second draft passed both tests. Time to do the work: about 4 minutes. The instruments functioned as quality gates, not creative generators — they told me the first version was dead but didn't write the second version for me. I had to find the specific details myself.

### Cycle 2: Giving Feedback on a Photograph

A photographer shares a portrait. Woman in her sixties, sitting at a kitchen table, morning light from a window on the left. Coffee cup in hand. Looking directly at camera. Sharp focus on her face, shallow depth of field blurring the kitchen behind her.

**First-pass feedback, writing naturally:**
"Beautiful portrait. The light is really nice and the composition draws the eye. There's a real warmth and authenticity here."

**Flinch Test:** Nothing. This is the photographic equivalent of "your work shows great promise." The photographer's body does not move. They've heard "beautiful light" and "warmth and authenticity" a thousand times. This feedback is a mirror — it reflects the photographer's intention back at them without adding anything.

**Rewrite:**
"The morning light is doing two things and they're fighting each other. It's soft on her face — flattering, warm, the obvious beauty of window light — but it's also making the coffee cup cast a hard diagonal shadow across the table that pulls the eye down and left, away from her. You've got a tender portrait competing with a still life. If you'd flagged her to set the cup down for three frames, or shifted her chair six inches right so the shadow falls off the table edge, the portrait would have nothing to compete with. Right now it's 80% there — the expression is the best thing in the image and the table is undermining it."

**Flinch Test:** The photographer either agrees about the shadow or disagrees, but they can't shrug. It's specific enough to check — look at the shadow, is it pulling the eye? The suggestion (move six inches, set the cup down) is actionable and concrete. This lands in the body as either "damn, you're right" or "no, I wanted that tension." Either way, movement.

**Flat Test:** "The cup's shadow distracts from the subject's face." Survives. Still specific, still about this photograph.

**Modifier check:** This is feedback to a working photographer, not a student. The directness is calibrated correctly — no hedging, no flattery preamble, but also no condescension. The "80% there" acknowledges the image is strong. The modifier holds.

**Result:** Same pattern as Cycle 1. The instruments caught the dead feedback instantly. The rewrite required me to actually look at the photograph and find something specific. The instruments are functioning as bullshit detectors — they can't make the work, but they can catch the faking.

### Cycle 3: Writing an Opening Paragraph for a Newsletter

Topic: Why most company "values" statements are meaningless.

**First attempt:**
"Every company has values. They're printed on walls, embedded in onboarding decks, and referenced in all-hands meetings. But how many companies actually live their values? The gap between stated values and lived behavior is one of the great unexamined contradictions of corporate life."

**Flinch Test:** Zero. "Every company has values" — yes, and water is wet. "The gap between stated values and lived behavior" is a topic sentence from a business school essay. There is no body in the room that flinches at this. It's a lecture beginning. The reader nods vaguely and keeps scrolling.

**Rewrite:**
"Stripe's first value is 'Users first.' In 2023, they laid off 14% of their workforce and the email from Patrick Collison said the leadership team had been 'too slow to hire' and 'too optimistic about the internet economy.' Notice what's missing: any mention of users. The layoff email for a company whose first value is 'users first' is entirely about the company. That's not hypocrisy — Collison's email was honest and well-written. It's something more interesting: values statements and operational reality exist in different languages, and almost no one notices when they stop translating between them."

**Flinch Test:** If you work at Stripe, you flinch. If you've written a values statement, you flinch differently — at the recognition that your own values and your own crisis communications probably have the same gap. The specific example (Stripe, the email, the missing word) does the work that the abstraction ("gap between stated and lived values") could not.

**Flat Test:** "Stripe's values statement says 'users first' but their layoff email didn't mention users. Most companies have a gap between their stated values and their crisis behavior." Survives. Still specific, still interesting, still makes you want to check your own company's last crisis communication against your values wall.

**Result:** The instruments are consistent. They catch generic openings and the rewrites that pass them share a quality: a named example with a specific, checkable detail. The instruments seem to demand proper nouns, dates, and verifiable facts as the price of admission.

### Cycle 4: Drafting a Rejection Email

Context: A design agency is declining a potential client project — a rebrand for a regional bank that wants to "modernize" but won't touch its existing color palette, name, typeface, or branch architecture.

**First attempt:**
"Thank you for considering us for this project. After careful review, we've determined that our approach may not be the best fit for your current needs. We wish you the best in finding a partner who can deliver the results you're looking for."

**Flinch Test:** This is a form letter wearing a human mask. No one's body responds to it. The bank receives it, files it, and moves on without any new information. The agency has said nothing about why they're declining, which means the bank can't learn from it and the agency hasn't been honest. No flinch — just corporate Muzak.

**Rewrite:**
"We're declining this project, and I want to be honest about why. A rebrand that can't change the name, colors, typeface, or physical spaces isn't a rebrand — it's a graphic design refresh, and that's a different scope with a different fee structure and a different kind of agency. We'd be overcharging you for work that doesn't require what we do. If your board's constraints change and the name or visual identity becomes open territory, call us — that's the project where we'd add real value. Until then, I'd recommend [specific agency name] — they're excellent at modernizing within tight constraints."

**Flinch Test:** The bank flinches at "isn't a rebrand — it's a graphic design refresh." That distinction either stings because it's true (their board hamstrung the project) or provokes defensiveness (they disagree about the definition). Either way, a body moves. The redirect to a specific competitor is generous and concrete.

**Flat Test:** "We're declining because the project constraints make it a refresh, not a rebrand, and we do rebrands." Survives. Specific, clear, honest.

**Modifier check:** This is a business communication with real relationship stakes. The directness is tempered by the referral and the open door ("if constraints change, call us"). The modifier — timing specificity to what the relationship can bear — is working. A harsher version could have said "your board is preventing you from doing real work" and that might pass the Flinch Test but fail the Modifier.

**Result:** The instruments caught the form-letter instantly. The rewrite is better business communication by any standard — clearer, more honest, more useful. But here's what's interesting: the Modifier did the most work in this cycle. The Flinch Test alone would have produced something too blunt for a business relationship. The Modifier calibrated the specificity to the context. In the previous three cycles, the Modifier was almost invisible. Here it was essential.

## What Happened

The instruments work as diagnostic tools. Across four completely different applications — brand positioning, photo critique, newsletter writing, business communication — they caught generic output within seconds and the rewrites that passed them were measurably better by any conventional standard.

Three findings surprised me:

First, the instruments are **gates, not generators**. They tell you what's dead but they don't create what's alive. The specific details in every rewrite came from domain knowledge and observation, not from the instruments themselves. A user without relevant knowledge would know their output was generic but couldn't fix it.

Second, the instruments seem to **demand proper nouns**. Every rewrite that passed the Flinch Test contained names, dates, dollar amounts, or verifiable details. The instruments may be, at bottom, a specificity framework that privileges the concrete over the abstract.

Third, the **Modifier earned its keep** in the rejection email but was nearly invisible in the other three cycles. It seems to activate only when the relationship between speaker and audience has real stakes — when specificity could damage rather than illuminate.

## Forward Instruction
The instruments work on single outputs. Now stress-test them on something they might not handle: a domain where "generic" is the correct answer. Apply them to technical documentation, safety warnings, legal language, or standardized procedures — places where specificity to the individual might be wrong and the general case is the point. See if they break or adapt.
