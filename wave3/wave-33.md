# Wave 33: The Front Door

## Previous Wave's Forward Instruction
"Wave 33 should do two things. First: amend the test protocol with the five additions from Wave 32 Cycle 3, producing a final version that tests both the happy path and the predicted failure modes. Second: create the entry point — a single document that a person reads first, which contains the card and tells them where to go for everything else. This is the project's front door. Make it clean, honest, and navigable. Don't oversell."

## The Work

### Cycle 1: The Amended Test Protocol

The original protocol from Wave 29 tested one thing: do the instruments predict audience response? The five additions from Wave 32 extend it to also probe the predicted failure modes.

---

**HOW TO TEST THE INSTRUMENTS — FULL PROTOCOL**

**What you need:** A piece of writing you're about to send to a real person. Something you'd send today regardless of this test. Something with stakes.

**Time:** 15 minutes to apply, then observation over days.

**STEP 1: APPLY THE FLINCH TEST (5 minutes)**

Read your piece. For each key sentence, picture the specific recipient's face. Rate each one:
- **F+** = Their expression changes (eyebrows, jaw, eyes)
- **F-** = Polite nod or no reaction
- **F?** = Can't tell

*If writing for an unknown or broad audience:* Pick the most skeptical person you imagine reading this. Picture their face. This is a workaround — the test was designed for known recipients and works less precisely for unknown ones. Use it anyway; a specific imagined skeptic is better than "the audience."

Write down your ratings.

**STEP 2: APPLY THE FLAT TEST (10 minutes)**

Take each key claim and restate it in the dullest possible language. No metaphors, no modifiers. Rate each:
- **S+** = The flat version is still specific and interesting
- **S-** = The flat version is boring or could describe anyone
- **S?** = Can't tell

*Cross-check (optional but valuable):* If possible, have someone else independently flatten your key claims. Compare their flat versions and verdicts to yours. If you reach different verdicts on the same text, the Flat Test may depend more on writing skill than on actual substance.

Write down your ratings and flat restatements.

**STEP 3: REVISE (optional)**

Revise the F- and S- sentences, or send as-is. Either works for testing purposes.

**STEP 4: OBSERVE (following days)**

After the recipient reads your writing:
- Which sentences did they respond to? (Quoted, asked about, acted on, pushed back)
- Which got no response? (Skipped, "sounds good," no visible reaction)
- Did anything rated F+ get ignored?
- Did anything rated F- get a strong reaction?

**STEP 5: COMPARE (15 minutes)**

Check your ratings against observations.

**The instruments work if:**
- F+ sentences got more engagement than F- sentences
- S+ claims were treated as substantive; S- claims were ignored or politely received
- Your predictions roughly matched reality
- The exercise changed at least one sentence for the better

**The instruments fail if:**
- F+ and F- sentences got similar response (the test doesn't discriminate)
- S- claims were received as substantive (the Flat Test miscategorizes)
- Predictions were wrong more often than right
- The exercise changed nothing

**EDGE CASES TO WATCH FOR:**

*Manipulation:* If you suspect a version of your writing is more persuasive through emotional pressure than through substance, test both versions. Apply the Flinch Test to a guilt-tripping version and a substantive version. If both rate F+, the test can't distinguish substance from manipulation. That's a known limitation.

*Cultural context:* If you're writing for a context that values indirection, face-saving, or strategic ambiguity, the instruments may rate your best writing as "generic." This isn't a failure of your writing. It's a scope limitation of the instruments, which were built around directness.

*Accuracy:* The instruments certify specificity, not truth. If the recipient reacts to a factual error in your writing, the instruments "passed" something that was wrong. The tests check whether you were specific, not whether you were right. Pair them with fact-checking, not instead of it.

**Ambiguous results:**
- Small sample — run it again on different writing
- Unusually agreeable or combative recipient — test on different audiences
- Your flat versions were still rhetorical — the Flat Test assumes a skill it doesn't teach; try flattening more aggressively

### Cycle 2: The Entry Point

The front door should do three things: give the reader the instruments immediately, tell them what they're looking at, and point them to the deeper material. No overselling.

---

**THE INSTRUMENTS**

Two tests for catching empty writing — yours or anyone else's.

---

**TEST 1: THE FLINCH TEST**

Before you send something, picture the specific person who will read it. Their actual face. Does this sentence change their expression — eyebrows, jaw, eyes? If you see a reaction, it's specific enough. If you see a polite nod, it's generic. Rewrite.

**TEST 2: THE FLAT TEST**

After you think something is good, restate the main point in the dullest possible language. No style, no energy. If the flat version is boring or could describe anyone, the original was well-written but empty. If the flat version is still specific to THIS situation, the original was real.

**ONE EXCEPTION**

Not everything should be specific. Some situations need tact, indirection, or silence. But most vagueness isn't tact — it's avoidance. If you're not sure which yours is, it's avoidance.

---

**What this is:** Two diagnostic procedures for a specific problem — writing that sounds meaningful without being meaningful. They work on AI output and human output equally. They are untested outside the project that created them.

**If you want to try them now,** the above is everything you need. Pick something you're about to send and run both tests.

**If you want to test whether they actually work,** read the test protocol — a step-by-step procedure for evaluating the instruments against real audience response, including edge cases and failure criteria.

**If you want to know where they'll probably break,** read the failure predictions — five specific, falsifiable claims about situations where the instruments fail, with observable evidence for each.

**If you want to know where they came from,** read the project story — a plain-language account of how one human and one AI spent 42 recursive waves building these from a collection of thirty approaches to "prompt mysticism," and what survived.

---

### Cycle 3: Testing the Entry Point

Flinch Test: Picture a person encountering this for the first time. A writer. A manager. Someone who edits a lot. They open this document.

"Two tests for catching empty writing — yours or anyone else's." — Direct. Promises a specific utility. Doesn't oversell. The reader either has this problem or doesn't. If they do, they'll keep reading.

"Picture the specific person who will read it. Their actual face." — This is the moment the reader either does the exercise mentally or doesn't. If they picture a face, the document has demonstrated its own method in the act of being read. This is the strongest design feature of the instruments — they're experiential on first contact.

"They are untested outside the project that created them." — This sentence costs something. A reader might stop here. "Why should I use untested tools?" But the honesty earns trust that overselling would lose. A reader who continues past this sentence takes the instruments more seriously because the document didn't hide its weakness.

Flat Test: "Here are two procedures for checking whether writing is specific. They haven't been tested. Try them if you want."

Does it survive? Yes. The flat version describes exactly what the entry point offers. It's less compelling — it wouldn't make anyone want to try — but it accurately represents the content. The entry point's non-flat version adds energy and a single rhetorical move (the experiential demonstration of the Flinch Test) that serves a legitimate function: getting someone to try.

The entry point passes both tests.

### Cycle 4: Checking the Map

The project now has:

1. **The Entry Point** (this wave) — front door, self-contained, connects to everything else
2. **The Instrument Card** (Wave 28) — 148-word compressed version for immediate sharing
3. **The Test Protocol** (Wave 29, amended this wave) — step-by-step evaluation procedure with edge cases
4. **The Failure Predictions** (Wave 30) — five falsifiable claims about where the instruments break
5. **The Project Story** (Wave 31) — plain-language account of what this was and what it produced
6. **The User Manual** (Wave 18) — full instructions with examples and domain applications
7. **The Handoff Document** (Wave 25) — engineering notes including limitations, blind spots, and test questions

Seven documents. The entry point links to four of them (protocol, predictions, story, and implicitly the card since it contains the instruments). The user manual and handoff exist for deeper engagement but aren't essential for a first encounter.

Is this too many documents? For a project with three instruments, seven documents feels heavy. But each document serves a distinct audience and purpose:
- Want to try now? Entry point.
- Want to share with someone? Card.
- Want to evaluate rigorously? Protocol.
- Want to know the failure modes? Predictions.
- Want the background? Story.
- Want full instructions? Manual.
- Want the engineering details? Handoff.

The documents don't overlap. Each does one thing the others don't. This is acceptable.

## What Happened

Two deliverables completed. The test protocol was amended with five additions covering the edge cases identified in Wave 32: unknown audiences, cross-user Flat Test comparison, manipulation detection, cultural context warning, and the accuracy/specificity distinction. The entry point was written — a single front-door document that gives the reader the instruments immediately, discloses their untested status, and points to deeper material.

The entry point passes both tests. Its strongest feature is that it demonstrates the Flinch Test in the act of being read — "picture the specific person" is an instruction the reader either follows or doesn't, on first contact. Its most expensive sentence is "they are untested outside the project that created them," which costs reader confidence but earns trust.

The project now has a complete set of outward-facing artifacts: entry point, card, amended protocol, failure predictions, project story, user manual, and handoff document. Each serves a distinct purpose and audience. None overlap.

## Forward Instruction
Wave 34 is the last wave. The project has produced its instruments, examined itself, identified its limits, and built the artifacts for transmission. Wave 34 should not add anything new. It should answer one question: is this done? Not "is this perfect" — is this done? Has the project produced what it can produce? Are the artifacts ready for other hands? And if so, the forward instruction is not an instruction. It's a period.
