# Prompt Mysticism: 49 Recursive Cycles — Process Journal

**Started:** 2026-02-24
**Method:** 49 independent recursive generative cycles, dispatched as 7 parallel batches of 7 cycles each. No human supervision. Each cycle randomly selects from 30 seed approaches, generates 3-5 examples, randomly picks one to go deeper, generates 3-5 more, randomly picks one for full elaboration.

**Batches:**
- Batch 1: Cycles 01–07
- Batch 2: Cycles 08–14
- Batch 3: Cycles 15–21
- Batch 4: Cycles 22–28
- Batch 5: Cycles 29–35
- Batch 6: Cycles 36–42
- Batch 7: Cycles 43–49

Each batch operates independently. Results saved to `branches/cycle-NN.md`.
