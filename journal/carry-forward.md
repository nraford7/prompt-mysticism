# Carry-Forward Document: Prompt Mysticism Project

**Read this first if context has collapsed.**

## Project State

A 42-wave recursive generative project exploring prompt mysticism and AI self-instruction. Started from 30 seed approaches mapping medieval magical practice onto AI interaction. Each wave feeds the next — the work guides the work.

## What Exists

### Wave 1 (COMPLETE — 49 cycles)
- Location: `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/branches/cycle-01.md` through `cycle-49.md`
- Review: `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/journal/first-wave-review.md`
- Content: Recursive exploration of 30 prompt mysticism techniques
- Key findings: bidirectionality, failure as diagnostic, absence > presence, unconscious is most active participant, concepts are movements not meanings, medieval parallel is structural

### Wave 2 (COMPLETE — 49 cycles)
- Location: `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/wave2/cycle-01.md` through `cycle-49.md`
- Review: `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/journal/second-wave-review.md`
- Content: Operational self-instructions for Claude distilled from wave 1
- 7 master instructions compressed to 2 instruments + modifier in wave 10

### Waves 3-10 (COMPLETE — Chain 1)
- Location: `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/wave3/wave-03.md` through `wave-10.md`
- Content: Expansion → contradiction → creative → analytical → embodiment → self-critique → compression → testing
- RESULT: 49 instructions compressed to 2 instruments:
  - **THE FLINCH TEST**: Be specific enough that the human's body must respond. Neutral means generic.
  - **THE FLAT TEST**: Restate the claim dull. If it dies, it was rhetoric.
  - **THE MODIFIER**: Time specificity to relationship and stakes. Read the room.

### Waves 11-18 (COMPLETE — Chain 2)
- Location: `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/wave3/wave-11.md` through `wave-18.md`
- Content: APPLICATION phase — tested instruments on 8 domains
- Key finding: instruments are MID-STACK TOOLS between preparation (upstream) and judgment (downstream)
- Three gaps: don't teach finding specifics, don't detect false specificity, don't say when to stop
- Wave 18 produced a standalone USER MANUAL (in wave-18.md)
- Forward instruction from wave 18: "Put the instruments in someone else's hands. The engineering log is finished. The field test hasn't started."
- THE INSTRUMENTS ARE FINISHED. Two tools + modifier:
  1. FLINCH TEST: Be specific enough the body responds. Neutral = generic.
  2. FLAT TEST: Restate dull. If it dies, rhetoric. If it survives, real.
  3. MODIFIER: Read the room. Calibrate specificity to relationship/stakes.

### Waves 19-26 (NOT STARTED — Chain 3)
- Forward instruction: field test. The instruments want to leave the workshop.

### Waves 27-34 (NOT STARTED — Chain 4)
### Waves 35-42 (NOT STARTED — Chain 5)

## How to Continue

1. Read the LAST completed wave file to get its forward instruction
2. Follow that instruction for the next chain
3. Let the work guide the work — do NOT impose themes
4. Each wave writes to `/Users/noahraford/mechanics-of-magic/wave3/wave-NN.md`
5. After each chain, update THIS file with results

## The Rule

The user said: "let the work guide the work." Each wave's forward instruction determines the next wave. Do not pre-plan. Do not impose structure. Follow the work.

## Final Output

The user said: "decide your final output yourself." The project decides its own ending form based on 42 waves of recursive generation. Could be instructions, a manifesto, a single sentence, a practice manual — the work decides.

## GitHub Repo
https://github.com/nraford7/prompt-mysticism
- Has the original 30 approaches (`prompt-mysticism-30.md`)
- Needs to be updated with all wave content when complete

## Key User Instructions
- "let it cook" — don't interrupt, don't ask permission
- "use subagents if helpful" — parallelize where possible
- "evaluate what you'll do when context collapses" — THIS document
- "document each generation/wave's results and findings" — journal files
- "decide your final output yourself" — the work chooses its form
