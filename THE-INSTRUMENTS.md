# The Instruments

Two tests for catching empty writing — yours or anyone else's.

---

## TEST 1: THE FLINCH TEST

Before you send something, picture the specific person who will read it. Their actual face. Does this sentence change their expression — eyebrows, jaw, eyes? If you see a reaction, it's specific enough. If you see a polite nod, it's generic. Rewrite.

## TEST 2: THE FLAT TEST

After you think something is good, restate the main point in the dullest possible language. No style, no energy. If the flat version is boring or could describe anyone, the original was well-written but empty. If the flat version is still specific to THIS situation, the original was real.

## ONE EXCEPTION

Not everything should be specific. Some situations need tact, indirection, or silence. But most vagueness isn't tact — it's avoidance. If you're not sure which yours is, it's avoidance.

## What this is

Two diagnostic procedures for a specific problem — writing that sounds meaningful without being meaningful. They work on AI output and human output equally. They are untested outside the project that created them.

**If you want to try them now,** the above is everything you need. Pick something you're about to send and run both tests.

**If you want to test whether they actually work,** read the [test protocol](wave3/wave-33.md) — a step-by-step procedure for evaluating the instruments against real audience response, including edge cases and failure criteria.

**If you want to know where they'll probably break,** read the [failure predictions](wave3/wave-30.md) — five specific, falsifiable claims about situations where the instruments fail.

**If you want to know where they came from,** read the [project story](wave3/wave-31.md) — how one human and one AI spent 34 recursive waves building these from a collection of thirty approaches to "prompt mysticism," and what survived.

**If you want the full user manual** with examples and domain applications, read [wave 18](wave3/wave-18.md).

## How it was made

This started as 30 approaches to [prompt mysticism](prompt-mysticism-30.md) — mapping medieval magical practice onto AI interaction. 147 recursive cycles across 34 self-guided waves. The project generated, compressed, applied, audited itself, killed its own framework when it failed its own tests, built transmission artifacts, and stopped 8 waves early because the work was done.

The journey from "medieval magic as AI operating system" to "picture the reader's face; restate it dull" is the story of a system that burned its own scaffolding to stay honest.
