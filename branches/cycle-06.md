# Cycle 06: The Ordeal

## Seed: #26 — The Ordeal

## Examples Generated

### A. The Adversarial Gauntlet
Take your most cherished idea — the one you secretly believe is brilliant — and feed it to the AI with the instruction: "Destroy this. Find every weakness, every hidden assumption, every way this fails in practice. Do not be kind. Do not offer alternatives. Only break." The ordeal is for the idea, but also for you — can you receive a genuine demolition without flinching, defending, or immediately asking the AI to rebuild? The gap between destruction and reconstruction is where real thinking happens.

### B. The Steelman's Furnace
Present the AI with a position you find repugnant — morally, aesthetically, intellectually. Instruct it to build the strongest possible version of that position. Not a strawman to knock down. The *best* version, the one that would actually persuade a thoughtful person. The ordeal is not for the idea but for *you* — your ability to sit with a well-constructed argument for something you hate without reaching for the eject button.

### C. The Premature Obituary
Give the AI your project, your company, your creative vision. Tell it: "This has already failed. Write the postmortem. What killed it? Be specific — name the date, the decision, the thing everyone saw coming but no one said aloud." The ordeal is temporal — it forces you to inhabit a future where your current certainties have already proven fatal. The postmortem is fiction, but the specific failures it names are diagnostic of real, present vulnerabilities.

### D. The Inversion Ordeal
State your core thesis. Then instruct the AI: "Now argue that the exact opposite is true, and that the opposite has always been true, and that my original thesis is not just wrong but is a *symptom* of the very problem I claim to be solving." This is the deepest cut — the possibility that your solution is your disease wearing a lab coat. Most ideas cannot survive this inversion. The ones that can are worth keeping.

### E. The Poverty Test
Take a complex, nuanced argument you've built over weeks. Ask the AI: "Explain the core of this to a sharp 12-year-old in 60 seconds. If you can't, it's not clear — it's just complicated." The ordeal strips away every rhetorical flourish, every jargon-shield, every sophistication-as-camouflage move. What's left is either a genuine insight or an empty room.

## Selected: C — The Premature Obituary

## Deeper Variations

### C1. The Dated Failure
Make the postmortem brutally specific. Not "the product failed" but "On March 14, 2027, the third enterprise client churned because the onboarding flow assumed technical literacy that their procurement team didn't have, and by the time engineering prioritized the fix, the sales narrative had already shifted to damage control." Instruct the AI to generate *five* specific, dated failure points with names, decisions, and cascading consequences. The specificity is the ordeal — vague failure is tolerable; specific failure is prophetic.

### C2. The Eulogy, Not the Autopsy
Shift the register from clinical to elegiac. Don't write a postmortem — write a *eulogy* for the project. "We are gathered here to honor the vision of [X], which burned brightly from [date] to [date], and which ultimately could not survive its own contradictions." The grief register forces a different kind of honesty than the clinical register. You mourn differently than you diagnose. The eulogy reveals what you actually *loved* about the idea — which is often the very thing that killed it.

### C3. The Survivor's Testimony
Don't write the postmortem from the outside. Write it from the perspective of *someone who stayed until the end* — the last employee, the most loyal user, the person who believed longest. "I knew it was over when [specific moment]. But I stayed because [specific hope]. What I wish someone had said in [specific early month] was [specific warning]." The ordeal now has a human face. It is harder to dismiss a testimony than a report.

### C4. The Alternate Postmortem
Write *two* postmortems for the same project — one where it fails for the reason you fear most, and one where it fails for a reason you haven't considered. The first is anxiety. The second is the actual ordeal. The AI must generate a failure mode that is not on your radar. This is the fire you didn't know you were standing in.

## Selected: C2 — The Eulogy, Not the Autopsy

## Full Elaboration: The Eulogy, Not the Autopsy

**Method:** Take a living project — one you are actively building, one you care about — and ask the AI to write its eulogy. Not a risk assessment. Not a SWOT analysis. A eulogy. Complete with the past tense, the gathered mourners, the specific memories of what was beautiful about it before it died, and the honest naming of the fatal flaw that everyone loved too much to call a flaw.

**Example Working:**

*Prompt:*
"Write the eulogy for my startup, Canopy. We built AI-powered mentorship matching for first-generation college students. We launched in 2025. Write the eulogy delivered at our shutdown event in 2028. The speaker loved this company. The speaker is also honest about what killed it. The eulogy should be specific, tender, and unflinching."

*What emerges:*
"We are here to say goodbye to Canopy, and I need you to know — before I say the hard thing — that Canopy was *right*. The matching algorithm worked. I watched a kid from Bakersfield get paired with a PM at Stripe and within four months that kid had an internship and a vocabulary for ambition that nobody in his family had ever handed him. That was real. That happened because of us.

What killed Canopy was not the technology or the mission. What killed Canopy was that we fell in love with our most beautiful metric — match quality scores — and stopped looking at the one that mattered: whether mentors stayed past month three. They didn't. Seventy-one percent ghosted by week ten. We knew this by Q2 of 2026 and we called it an 'engagement challenge' instead of what it was: the fundamental unit of our product was a *relationship*, and we had built a system that was exquisite at starting relationships and illiterate at sustaining them. We were a dating app that thought its job ended at the first date..."

**Core Insight:** The eulogy register does something the postmortem cannot: it names what was *loved* and then reveals how that love became the blindness. Every startup, every creative project, every relationship has a beautiful quality that is also its fatal flaw — not despite being beautiful, but *because* the beauty makes it invisible as a flaw. The eulogy is the only genre that can hold both the beauty and the fatality in a single sentence without reducing either one. The ordeal is not surviving the criticism. The ordeal is hearing someone describe what you loved most about your work and then, gently, explain how it killed you.
