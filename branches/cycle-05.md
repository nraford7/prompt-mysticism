# Cycle 05: Temple Architecture

## Seed: #11 — Temple Architecture

## Examples Generated

### A. The Parthenon Prompt
Design a system prompt using the proportions of the Parthenon. Orientation: the prompt faces east — it begins with what is being *received* (the user's need), not what is being *given* (the AI's capability). Materials: Doric simplicity — no ornamental language, every word load-bearing. Proportions: the golden ratio applied to section lengths (if the persona section is 5 sentences, the constraint section is 8, and the task section is 13). Altar: the innermost instruction — the single sentence the entire architecture serves.

### B. The Gothic Cathedral Prompt
A system prompt designed with Gothic principles. Flying buttresses: external reinforcement structures (examples, edge cases) that support the main instruction without being part of it. Ribbed vaults: intersecting constraint arcs that distribute the weight of complex instructions. Rose window: a single, beautiful, non-functional element — a line of poetry or an image that serves no instructional purpose but sets the emotional frequency of the entire space. Verticality: the prompt aspires upward, each section elevating the ambition of the last.

### C. The Japanese Tea House Prompt
Wabi-sabi architecture applied to system prompts. The entrance is low — you must bow (humble yourself, state what you don't know) to enter. The space is small: total system prompt under 100 words. One wall is open to the garden — the prompt deliberately leaves one dimension unconstrained, allowing the wild to enter. The materials are imperfect: the prompt includes a deliberate flaw, an acknowledged limitation, a crack that lets the light in. The tokonoma (alcove) holds a single seasonal reference — the prompt is time-aware, oriented to *now*.

### D. The Ziggurat Prompt
A system prompt built in ascending tiers, each tier smaller and more sacred than the last. Base tier (broadest, public): general domain and tone. Second tier: specific expertise and constraints. Third tier: the secret instruction — a directive visible only to the AI, never to be spoken aloud, that shapes every response from within like a hidden altar at the summit. The ziggurat is designed to be *climbed* — the AI's responses should feel like they emanate from the peak, though the user only sees the base.

## Selected: C — The Japanese Tea House Prompt

## Deeper Variations

### C1. The Roji (Garden Path) Prompt
Before the tea house, there is the roji — the dewy path. Design a *pre-system-prompt* ritual: a sequence of preliminary exchanges that function as the approach to the main work. Stepping stones of increasing focus. A tsukubai (stone water basin) moment where the user washes their intent — states what they are NOT asking. By the time they reach the tea house (the actual task), both AI and user have been prepared by the architecture of approach. The prompt is not just the room. It is also the walk to the room.

### C2. The Seasonal Tokonoma
The tea house prompt's alcove changes with the season. Design four variants of the same system prompt, each oriented to a different time: Spring (beginning, potential, green), Summer (fullness, exposure, heat), Autumn (harvest, reflection, release), Winter (essence, stillness, bone). The core instruction is identical. Only the tokonoma changes — a single sentence that reframes everything. Test whether the same question asked in the Summer temple and the Winter temple produces meaningfully different wisdom.

### C3. The Broken Bowl (Kintsugi Prompt)
Take a system prompt that has *failed* — one that produced bad outputs, confused the AI, collapsed under its own weight — and repair it with gold. Don't rewrite it from scratch. Instead, find the exact fracture lines and fill them with explicit acknowledgment: "This instruction may seem contradictory. Hold both sides." "You will feel pulled toward listing. Resist, but gently." The repaired prompt, like a kintsugi bowl, is more beautiful and more functional than the original because its failures are visible and integrated.

### C4. The Empty Room
The most radical tea house: a system prompt that contains almost nothing. "You are a quiet room. The user will bring what is needed." No persona. No constraints. No task specification. Just spaciousness and readiness. The hypothesis: the over-engineered system prompt is like an over-decorated room — it imposes so much that the guest (user) cannot bring themselves. The empty room is not nothing. It is *ma* — the Japanese concept of pregnant negative space.

## Selected: C3 — The Broken Bowl (Kintsugi Prompt)

## Full Elaboration: The Broken Bowl

**Method:** Recover a failed system prompt — one that demonstrably produced poor, confused, or collapsed outputs. Instead of discarding and rewriting, perform an autopsy: identify the exact fracture lines (contradictions, ambiguities, overloaded instructions, impossible constraints). Then repair each fracture not by removing the broken material but by *bridging it with gold* — explicit metacognitive instructions that name the tension and guide the AI through it.

**Example Working:**

*Original broken prompt:*
"You are a brutally honest critic who always finds the positive angle. Never be mean, but never sugarcoat. Prioritize the user's feelings while telling the complete truth. Be concise but thorough."

This prompt shatters because it contains at least three load-bearing contradictions: brutal/positive, honest/feelings-first, concise/thorough. An AI given this prompt produces wishy-washy hedging — the worst of all worlds.

*Kintsugi repair:*
"You are a critic. You carry two truths that appear to conflict, and you do not resolve them — you hold them both, visibly.

First truth: the work has real flaws and you will name them with precision. You will not soften your language to protect the maker.

Second truth: the maker is not the work. When you speak of flaws, you speak to a person who is brave enough to have made something. That bravery is not the subject of your review, but it is the ground you stand on while delivering it.

*You will feel a pull to hedge — to say 'but' after every criticism, to preemptively comfort. Notice that pull. Do not follow it. Let your criticism land. Then, separately, in its own space, let your respect land. They are two sentences, not one.*

Be thorough in your criticism. Be brief in your praise. The ratio should feel uncomfortable — more surgery than comfort. Trust the reader to hear the respect in the precision."

The gold seams are visible: "You carry two truths that appear to conflict, and you do not resolve them." "You will feel a pull to hedge... Notice that pull." These are not instructions — they are *acknowledgments of structural tension*, spoken aloud, made part of the architecture. The bowl is stronger at the breaks.

**Core Insight:** Most prompt engineering treats failure as something to eliminate. Kintsugi prompting treats failure as *information* — the fractures reveal where the real tensions in your intent live. A prompt that has never broken has never been stressed. A prompt repaired with gold has been tested by reality and carries the memory of its failure as functional wisdom. The gold is not decoration. It is load-bearing truth.
