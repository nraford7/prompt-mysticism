# Cycle 23: Fasting Prompts

## Seed: #24 — Fasting Prompts

## Examples Generated
### A. The One-Word Summons
Feed the AI a single word — not a question, not an instruction, just a word. "Threshold." "Cartilage." "Vespers." Document what comes back. The hypothesis: stripped of all directional scaffolding, the AI's response reveals its deepest default attractors. The word doesn't guide — it seeds. What grows from a single seed, unguided, is the AI's own garden.

### B. The Poverty Prompt
Rewrite a complex multi-paragraph system prompt as the shortest possible version that still produces equivalent output. Keep cutting. Find the minimum viable prompt — the point where removing one more word collapses the output. That boundary is the load-bearing language. Everything else was decoration.

### C. The Empty Frame
Give the AI nothing but structure: "Section 1: []. Section 2: []. Section 3: []." No content, no topic, no instruction. Just a skeleton. See what it fills the bones with. The frame itself is the only prompt. This tests whether structure alone — without semantic content — carries generative information.

### D. The Silence Before
Begin a conversation with a system prompt that says only: "Wait." Then, after three empty user messages, finally ask your real question. Test whether the AI's response to the question changes when preceded by structured silence versus asked cold. The fasting is temporal — you're starving the conversation of content before feeding it.

### E. The Three-Token Oracle
Constrain yourself to exactly three tokens per prompt. Not three words — three tokens (which the AI parses differently than humans). "Build. Recursive. Cathedrals." "Dissolve. The. Obvious." The extreme compression forces you to find the three most potent tokens for your intent. It's prompt haiku — and like haiku, the constraint is the art.

## Selected: B — The Poverty Prompt

## Deeper Variations
### B1. The Load-Bearing Word
Take a system prompt that works well. Delete words one at a time, testing after each deletion. Map exactly which words, when removed, cause output degradation. Build a "structural analysis" of the prompt the way an engineer analyzes a bridge — identifying which elements carry load and which are decorative. The result: a map of where meaning actually lives in your prompt.

### B2. The Anorexic Persona
Take a rich, detailed persona prompt (200+ words) and compress it to its absolute minimum while maintaining the persona's distinctive voice. Find the irreducible core of a character. The hypothesis: most persona prompts are 80% redundant. The voice lives in 3-5 key phrases. Finding them teaches you what actually constitutes identity in language.

### B3. The Caloric Theory of Tokens
Treat tokens like calories — develop a "nutritional theory" of prompts. Some tokens are empty calories (filler, hedging, redundancy). Some are protein (load-bearing structure). Some are fat (context that enables but doesn't directly contribute). Analyze your prompts with this metabolic lens. Develop a "diet" for prompt writing. The fasting prompt isn't just minimal — it's optimally nourished.

### B4. Prompt Compression Ratio
Take 10 prompts that produce good output. Compress each to 50%, 25%, 10% of original length. Chart output quality against compression ratio. Find the curve. The hypothesis: quality doesn't degrade linearly. There's a cliff — a point where compression becomes catastrophic. That cliff's location tells you something about how much redundancy language needs to function.

## Selected: B1 — The Load-Bearing Word

## Full Elaboration: The Load-Bearing Word

**Method:** Take a prompt you know works. Perform systematic single-word deletions, testing output after each removal. Map which words are structural (their removal degrades output) and which are ornamental (their removal changes nothing). Build a load map of the prompt.

**The Working:**

Start with a prompt you've tested and trust. Example: *"You are a rigorous but compassionate editor. Read the following draft. Identify the three weakest sentences. For each, explain specifically why it fails and offer a concrete revision."*

That's 30 words. Now delete them one at a time. Remove "rigorous" — does the output lose precision? Remove "but" — does the output lose the tension between rigor and compassion? Remove "compassionate" — do the revisions become harsher? Remove "specifically" — do the explanations become vague? Remove "concrete" — do the revisions become abstract?

What you'll find: some words are keystones. "Specifically" and "concrete" probably carry enormous load — they're the difference between generic feedback and useful feedback. "Rigorous" and "compassionate" might be partially redundant with each other (the "but" creates the tension that implies both). "Three" is structural — remove it and you get an unpredictable number of responses.

But here's the genuinely strange finding: some words carry load you wouldn't predict. "Following" in "the following draft" might matter more than you'd think — it creates temporal orientation, telling the AI something is coming. "Read" might be doing more than you expect — it sets a mode (analytical reception) before the instruction arrives.

**Core Insight:** Language is an engineering material, and most of us use it like amateurs pouring concrete — more is safer. The fasting prompt discipline reveals that prompts, like bridges, have load-bearing members and decorative facades. But unlike bridges, the load-bearing words aren't always the ones that look structural. Sometimes a small, seemingly trivial word — a preposition, an article, an adverb — is holding up the entire output. The fasting discipline teaches you to see your own language as a structure rather than a stream. And the medieval resonance is exact: the ascetic who fasts doesn't become weaker. They become more aware of what each calorie does. Poverty as power. Reduction as revelation.
