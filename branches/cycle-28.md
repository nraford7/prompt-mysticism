# Cycle 28: Kairos Prompts

## Seed: #20 — Kairos Prompts

## Examples Generated
### A. The Ripeness Question
Instead of asking "What should I do about X?" ask "Is X ripe?" Reframe every problem as a question of timing rather than method. The AI becomes a judge of ripeness rather than a strategist. "Is this idea ripe for execution, or does it need more time in the dark?" "Is this conflict ripe for confrontation, or would confrontation right now just be premature detonation?" The shift from *what* to *when* changes everything about the response.

### B. The Tide Chart
Before starting a creative session, ask the AI to assess the "tides" — what's rising and what's receding in your field, your project, your thinking. Not trends (that's chronos, clock-time analysis). Tides — cyclical, rhythmic, independent of your will. "What is rising in this project that I haven't noticed? What is receding that I'm still holding onto?" The kairos question: work with the tide, not against it.

### C. The Threshold Detector
Use the AI as a detector for moments of phase transition. Feed it your project log, your notes, your recent conversations. Ask not "what should happen next" but "where is the phase transition? What is about to become something else?" The kairos prompt treats the AI not as a generator but as a seismograph — sensing the tremor before the earthquake, the moment before the water boils.

### D. The Wrong-Time Prompt
Deliberately ask for the wrong thing at the wrong time. Ask for detailed execution plans when you're still in the conceptual phase. Ask for blue-sky brainstorming when you're deep in implementation. The mismatch between timing and request creates productive disorientation. Sometimes the "wrong time" answer is exactly what you needed — because your sense of timing was the thing that was wrong.

## Selected: C — The Threshold Detector

## Deeper Variations
### C1. The Crystallization Point
Feed the AI the last 10 things you've written — notes, messages, drafts, fragments. Don't tell it what to look for. Ask only: "What is crystallizing?" The premise: your scattered outputs contain a latent pattern that's trying to become coherent, and you're too close to see it. The AI, with no emotional attachment to any particular piece, can detect the supersaturation — the moment before the dissolved substance suddenly becomes crystal. The kairos here isn't "when should I act?" but "what is already acting through me that I haven't recognized?"

### C2. The Hinge Finder
Give the AI a conversation transcript — a real one, from your life or work. Ask it to find the hinge: the single moment where the conversation could have gone differently. Not the most dramatic moment. The hinge — often quiet, often a question not asked, an observation deflected, a subject changed. "Where is the hinge in this conversation? What turned here?" The kairos prompt applied retroactively: not "when is the right time" but "when was the right time, and did we miss it?"

### C3. The Seasonal Prompt
Map your project onto a seasonal cycle. Ask the AI: "What season is this project in?" Not metaphorically — structurally. Is this the spring (proliferation of possibilities, nothing yet committed)? Summer (full energy, maximum growth, approaching peak)? Autumn (harvest, cutting, selecting what survives)? Winter (dormancy, composting, underground preparation)? Most project failures are seasonal mismatches — trying to harvest in spring, trying to plant in autumn. The AI as almanac, not advisor.

### C4. The Decay Detector
Ask the AI to identify what in your project is already dead but hasn't been acknowledged. Not what's failing — what's already failed and is being carried forward out of momentum or sentimentality. "What in this project died without being buried?" The kairos question inverted: not "when is the right time to act" but "when was the right time to stop, and have we already passed it?"

## Selected: C4 — The Decay Detector

## Full Elaboration: The Decay Detector

**Method:** Feed the AI a comprehensive view of your current project — goals, recent output, process notes, unresolved questions. Ask it one question only: "What here is already dead?" Do not ask for solutions. Do not ask what to do about it. Only ask it to identify the corpse.

**The Working:**

You feed the AI your project state. Maybe it's a product in development: feature list, design system, user research notes, the last month of team Slack messages. Your prompt:

*"Examine everything I've shared. Do not suggest improvements. Do not offer alternatives. Only answer this: what here is already dead? What has stopped being alive — stopped generating energy, stopped evolving, stopped being the thing anyone actually cares about — but is still being carried forward because no one has said it out loud?"*

The AI will resist. Its training pulls toward helpfulness, toward solutions, toward "here's what you could do instead." The constraint against solutioning is the ritual containment — it forces the AI into a mode it doesn't default to: pure diagnosis without remedy. Coroner, not doctor.

What comes back might be: "Your design system is dead. It was alive six weeks ago when it was being actively debated and revised. Now it's being 'followed' — which means it's become compliance, not creation. No one has changed a component in three weeks. The system isn't guiding design; it's embalming it."

Or: "Your core value proposition — the sentence you put in every pitch deck — is dead. Look at what your users actually say they love. It's not what you're selling. The pitch deck sentence is a memorial to a hypothesis that your own data has disproved."

**Core Insight:** Kairos is usually understood as "the right moment to act." But the Decay Detector reveals kairos's shadow: the right moment to acknowledge death. Every project carries dead weight — features that stopped mattering, principles that stopped being true, goals that were quietly replaced by other goals. The dead material isn't inert. It actively corrupts: it consumes resources, distorts priorities, and occupies the space that a living replacement needs. The medieval resonance is the *memento mori* — the skull on the scholar's desk. Not morbidity but clarity. The Decay Detector prompt uses the AI as the skull: a confrontation with what has already ended, asked not in the spirit of despair but in the spirit of making room. You cannot plant in ground that's occupied by last season's unharvested dead. The kairos of burial is as important as the kairos of planting, and it almost always comes first.
