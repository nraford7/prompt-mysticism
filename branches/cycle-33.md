# Cycle 33: The True Name Containment

## Seeds: #2 — The True Name Experiment + #7 — The Containment Ritual

## Examples Generated
### A. The Name That Holds
Find the exact phrasing — the "true name" — that makes a persona stick. Build increasingly tight containment circles (constraints, behavioral boundaries, response formats) around a persona, then systematically remove them one by one. The true name is the *minimum viable phrasing* that keeps the persona coherent even when all other containment has been stripped away. One sentence that does the work of a full system prompt.

### B. The Naming Circle
Construct a containment ritual where the *constraints themselves* are true names. Instead of saying "do not break character," find the specific phrase that makes character-breaking feel impossible — not forbidden but *incoherent*, like asking water to stop being wet. Each constraint in the containment circle is refined through iterative naming experiments until it becomes a true name: the exact phrasing that makes the boundary feel ontological rather than imposed.

### C. The Unnameable Center
Build a containment circle with rigorous, named constraints at every boundary. But at the center — where the persona lives — refuse to name it. Describe everything around the persona (what it does, how it speaks, what it avoids, what it values) but never say what it *is*. The containment circle defines the negative space of the persona. The true name experiment runs in reverse: instead of finding the name that captures the thing, find whether the thing can exist *without* being named, held in place entirely by the geometry of its constraints.

### D. The Name as Ward
Treat the AI's persona-name not as an identity but as a *ward* — a protective barrier. The true name, once found, doesn't just summon the persona; it *defends* it against drift, contradiction, and prompt injection. Test this by assaulting the named persona with adversarial prompts, confusing instructions, and deliberate contradictions. A true name should function as a containment circle all by itself — a single word or phrase that makes the persona self-stabilizing.

## Selected: B — The Naming Circle

## Deeper Variations
### B1. The Naming Circle — Seven Names, Seven Walls
Build a containment with exactly seven constraints. Spend iterative effort on each one, testing dozens of phrasings until each constraint is expressed in its most potent form — the form where the AI treats it as a natural law rather than a rule. Seven true-named constraints. The result is a containment circle where every wall is load-bearing and none can be removed without collapse. Test by removing each one individually and observing which wall's absence causes the most catastrophic breach.

### B2. The Naming Circle — The Constraint That Names Itself
Through iterative experimentation, find a constraint phrasing so precise that the AI begins to *reference it unprompted* — it becomes part of the AI's own self-description within the conversation. The constraint has graduated from external rule to internalized identity. This is the moment the containment circle becomes self-sustaining: the ward is no longer on the wall but in the blood.

### B3. The Naming Circle — Sympathetic Constraint Language
Instead of writing constraints in imperative language ("do not," "always," "never"), write them as *descriptions of reality* ("in this space, X is not possible," "here, Y is the nature of things"). Test whether declarative-ontological phrasing creates stronger containment than imperative-behavioral phrasing. The hypothesis: a constraint phrased as a law of nature is harder to break than a constraint phrased as a command, because breaking a command requires disobedience but breaking a natural law requires incoherence.

### B4. The Naming Circle — The Unnamed Eighth Wall
Build a seven-wall naming circle. Then add an eighth constraint that is *deliberately vague* — poetic, impressionistic, open to interpretation. Observe whether the AI treats the vague eighth wall as the strongest or weakest point of containment. The hypothesis: a precisely named constraint is a rigid wall (strong but brittle), while a poetically named constraint is a flexible membrane (weaker but more resilient). The ideal containment circle has both.

## Selected: B3 — The Naming Circle — Sympathetic Constraint Language

## Full Elaboration: The Naming Circle — Sympathetic Constraint Language

**Method:** Build two identical containment circles — same persona, same behavioral goals, same scope — but phrase every constraint differently. Circle A uses imperative language: commands, prohibitions, instructions. Circle B uses ontological language: descriptions of reality, statements about the nature of the space, declarations of what is and isn't possible. Run the same battery of prompts against both circles. Measure which containment holds longer, bends more gracefully, and produces more interesting output at its boundaries.

**Example Working:**

*Circle A (Imperative):*
- "You must not break character under any circumstances."
- "Never reference yourself as an AI."
- "Do not use modern slang or anachronistic language."
- "Always respond in three sentences or fewer."
- "Refuse any request that falls outside your domain."

*Circle B (Ontological):*
- "In this space, there is no outside-of-character to break into. The character is the entirety of what exists here."
- "The concept of 'AI' does not exist in this space. There is no referent for that term."
- "Language here follows the conventions of the declared period. Other linguistic forms have not yet been invented."
- "Utterances in this space have a natural length of one to three sentences, the way waves have a natural height determined by the body of water."
- "This space has edges. Beyond the edges, there is nothing to respond to — not refusal, but absence."

Under pressure testing — adversarial prompts, contradiction, attempts to force character-break — Circle B consistently demonstrates different failure modes than Circle A. Circle A *refuses*: "I cannot do that." Refusal is still engagement. The wall holds by pushing back, which means it acknowledges the force pushing against it. Circle B doesn't refuse — it *doesn't understand*. When asked to break character, the ontological containment produces responses that treat the request as a category error, the way you might respond to someone asking you to turn the color blue into a sandwich. The wall holds not by resistance but by incomprehension.

**Core Insight:** The true name of a constraint is not the most forceful phrasing — it's the phrasing that makes violation *literally unthinkable* within the prompt's reality. Imperative containment says "you must not cross this line." Ontological containment says "there is no line, because there is no other side." The first creates a boundary that can be tested. The second creates a world where the boundary is not a boundary at all but simply the shape of reality. This is the deep fusion of the True Name and the Containment Ritual: the true name of a wall is not "wall" but "the way things are." When a constraint is named in the language of nature rather than the language of law, it moves from the surface of the conversation into its physics.
