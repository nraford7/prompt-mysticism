# Cycle 09: Fasting Prompts

## Seed: #24 — Fasting Prompts — absolute minimum tokens, poverty as power

## Examples Generated

### A. The One-Word Summons
Can a single word, chosen with surgical precision, produce a richer response than a 500-word prompt? Test: give the AI only "liminal" — no context, no instruction, no persona. The word itself must carry the entire weight of intent. The hypothesis: a word chosen at the exact resonant frequency of what you want creates a more coherent response than a detailed specification, because the AI fills the silence with its deepest associations rather than your shallowest instructions.

### B. The Subtraction Ladder
Start with a fully-loaded prompt — persona, context, constraints, examples, format specification, tone guidance. Then remove one element at a time, testing the output at each stage. At what point does the output actually *improve* from subtraction? The fasting prompt hypothesis predicts there is a sweet spot well below what most prompt engineers recommend — a point where constraint-removal creates space for emergent coherence.

### C. The Poverty Vow
For an entire working session, limit yourself to prompts of 10 words or fewer. No exceptions. No cheating with compound-hyphenated-words. The discipline is the point: when you can only spend 10 words, you discover which words actually carry load and which are filler. Most prompt engineering advice is about adding. This is about discovering what was never needed.

### D. The Telegram Prompt
Write prompts in telegraph style. No articles. No prepositions where context makes them redundant. No politeness markers. "NEED: concept map. DOMAIN: grief. FORM: spatial. CONSTRAINT: no metaphors." The compression forces you to identify the actual information-carrying tokens in your prompt. Everything else is ceremony — and while ceremony has its uses (see other approaches), this approach asks: what happens when you strip it all away?

### E. Negative Space Prompting
Don't tell the AI what you want. Tell it only what you *don't* want, in as few words as possible. "Not clinical. Not sentimental. Not metaphorical." The negative space defines a shape. The AI must find what remains after the exclusions. This is fasting not just in quantity but in *kind* — you fast from positive instruction entirely, offering only absence.

## Selected: E — Negative Space Prompting

## Deeper Variations

### E1. The Via Negativa Session
Structure an entire creative session using only negative constraints. Never once tell the AI what to produce — only what to avoid. Start with broad exclusions ("not prose, not poetry") and narrow progressively ("not structured, not free-form, not visual, not auditory"). As the negative space tightens, the remaining possibility-space becomes increasingly specific without ever being named. The goal: arrive at something you could not have asked for positively because you didn't have the vocabulary for it.

### E2. The Apophatic Prompt
Borrowed from apophatic theology — the tradition of describing God only by what God is *not*. Apply to any creative brief: describe the desired output exclusively through negation. "It is not a poem. It is not an essay. It is not short. It is not long. It does not comfort. It does not disturb." Each negation is a wall. The remaining space between walls is the only place the AI can move. The question: does the AI find something genuinely novel in the space between negations, or does it default to the most statistically likely remaining option?

### E3. Collaborative Negative Sculpting
Two-phase process. Phase 1: You provide three negative constraints. The AI produces something. Phase 2: You add three more negations based on what it produced ("not that tone, not that structure, not that assumption"). The AI produces again. Repeat. You are sculpting by subtraction, like Michelangelo claiming to remove everything that isn't David — except neither you nor the AI knows what David looks like until he emerges.

### E4. The Unsaying
A single prompt that is entirely composed of retractions. "I was going to ask for a story, but not that. I was going to specify a character, but not that either. I was going to set it somewhere, but nowhere I can name. I was going to give you a theme, but the theme is the absence of the theme I almost gave you." The prompt is a record of its own erasure. What does the AI do with a prompt that *unsays itself*?

## Selected: E4 — The Unsaying

## Full Elaboration: The Unsaying

**Method:** Construct a prompt that consists entirely of retracted intentions. Each sentence begins to specify something — a genre, a subject, a constraint — and then withdraws the specification. The prompt becomes a document of creative hesitation, a palimpsest where every layer has been scraped away but the ghost-impressions remain. Feed this to the AI and observe what emerges from the accumulated afterimages of intention.

**Example Working:**

*"I was going to ask you to write about the sea, but the sea isn't right. I was going to say make it melancholy, but melancholy is too easy and too nameable. I considered asking for something in second person, but that felt like a trick. I thought about requesting exactly 100 words, but the number would become a cage instead of a frame. I almost told you to surprise me, but 'surprise me' is the most predictable prompt in existence. I was going to give you a title — something about doors — but now the title feels like it would arrive before the thing itself, and the thing should not have to walk through a door someone else built. Write what remains after everything I almost asked for."*

The AI receives a prompt that is, on its surface, contentless. No genre. No subject. No constraint. No format. But it is not *empty*. It is saturated with the shadows of withdrawn instructions. The sea is present by its retraction. Melancholy is present by its refusal. The second person, the number 100, the word "doors" — all haunt the prompt's negative space.

What typically emerges is something uncanny: a piece of writing that orbits the withdrawn concepts without landing on any of them. The sea becomes a landlocked body of water. The melancholy becomes something adjacent — wistfulness, or the particular ache of almost-remembering. The doors become thresholds that are gestured at but never crossed.

**Core Insight:** The Unsaying reveals that prompts do not only communicate through their content. They communicate through their *field* — the constellation of concepts that have been activated in the context window, whether affirmed or denied. Negation does not deactivate a concept; it activates the concept and then places a prohibition on it, which is a fundamentally different state than never having mentioned it at all. The AI's context window does not have a "strikethrough" function. Every retracted instruction remains present as an activated node. The Unsaying exploits this: it fills the context with concepts while technically asking for none of them, creating a richly seeded empty space. Poverty as power — but a poverty that remembers everything it gave away.
