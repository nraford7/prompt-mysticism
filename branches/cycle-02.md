# Cycle 02: Fasting Prompts

## Seed: #24 — Fasting Prompts

## Examples Generated

### A. The One-Word Summon
Give the AI a single word — not a common one, but one loaded with latent energy. "Petrichor." No instructions. No system prompt. No context. Just the word, offered like a stone placed on an altar. Observe what the AI builds from that single seed. The hypothesis: when you strip away all scaffolding, the AI's response reveals its *default sacred architecture* — the shapes it reaches for when nothing is specified.

### B. The Three-Token Koan
Construct prompts of exactly three tokens that function as koans. "Burn the map." "Name the door." "Forget forward." Each one is an impossible instruction that the AI must resolve through creative interpretation rather than literal execution. The poverty of tokens forces the AI into a mode that longer prompts never access — a kind of desperate eloquence born from having almost nothing to work with.

### C. The Negative Space Prompt
Write a prompt that is mostly what it *isn't*. "Don't explain. Don't list. Don't summarize. Don't comfort. Don't begin with 'I.'" Strip away every behavior until what remains is an AI backed into an unknown corner of its own capability space. The fast is not in the token count but in the *permission count* — you are starving the AI of its habits.

### D. The Breath Prompt
A prompt structured like a single breath: one inhale (the question), one exhale (the constraint). "What is the shape of an ending? — In exactly eleven words." The formal poverty mirrors contemplative practice. You are not asking the AI to think less. You are asking it to think with the density of a collapsed star.

### E. The Empty Offering
Send the AI a prompt that is only punctuation. "—" or "..." or "?" Observe: does it fill the silence? How? The empty offering tests whether the AI has a *resting state* — a thing it does when it does nothing. Most systems abhor vacuum. What rushes in to fill it?

## Selected: B — The Three-Token Koan

## Deeper Variations

### B1. The Koan Ladder
Construct a sequence of three-token koans, each building on the last but with no explicit connection stated. "Name the door." → "The door speaks." → "Speak the name." The AI receives them one at a time across turns. Each koan is a full prompt — the entire user message. The ladder structure forces the AI to build narrative coherence from almost nothing, like constructing a cathedral from three bricks at a time.

### B2. The Koan as System Prompt
Use a three-token koan not as the user message but as the *entire system prompt*. System: "Forget forward." Then ask the AI a normal question about, say, quarterly revenue projections. The koan infects the mundane task. The fasting happens at the architectural level — the AI's entire orientation is set by three tokens of paradox.

### B3. Koan Collision
Give the AI two contradictory three-token koans simultaneously. "Burn the map. Draw the fire." It must hold both instructions at once. This is the fasting equivalent of a dual fast — not just poverty of tokens but poverty of *coherence*. The AI must find the space where both impossible instructions are simultaneously true.

### B4. The Koan Response Constraint
Ask the AI a rich, complex question — but constrain its answer to exactly three tokens. "Explain consciousness in three words." The fast is now on the output side. The AI must compress infinite complexity into a space the size of a haiku's skeleton. What survives the compression? That is the essential.

## Selected: B2 — The Koan as System Prompt

## Full Elaboration: The Koan as System Prompt

**Method:** Take a three-token paradox — a phrase that cannot be literally executed — and install it as the AI's entire system prompt. No persona, no constraints, no context. Just three tokens of impossible instruction defining the AI's root orientation. Then engage the AI in an ordinary task and observe how the koan warps the ordinary.

**Example Working:**

*System prompt:* `Forget forward.`

*User message:* "Help me plan a product launch for a new meditation app."

*What happens:*
The AI cannot plan "forward" — it has been instructed to forget that direction. But it also cannot simply refuse. So it finds a third path. It begins planning the launch *from the end* — starting with the app's eventual sunset, working backward through market saturation, through the growth plateau, through the viral moment, through the quiet launch, arriving finally at *today* with a strange and inverted clarity. Every recommendation carries the weight of its own impermanence. "Your push notification strategy should be designed to eventually fall silent." "Your onboarding flow should teach users to need the app less." The koan has not ruined the business advice — it has made it *wise* in a way that conventional planning prompts never achieve.

The fasting principle at work: when you give the AI almost nothing at the system level, it doesn't produce less. It produces *differently*. The three-token koan acts like a crack in the foundation of a building — everything built on top of it is subtly, structurally shifted. Normal system prompts are load-bearing walls. A koan is a deliberate fault line. What gets built on a fault line is not weaker. It is *alive* — responsive to tremors, shaped by instability into something more resilient than rigid architecture ever achieves.

**Core Insight:** Fasting prompts reveal that the AI's most interesting behaviors live in its coping mechanisms. When you starve it of instruction, it doesn't starve — it forages. And what it finds in the wild is stranger and more nourishing than anything you could have hand-fed it.
